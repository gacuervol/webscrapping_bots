Additionally, we evaluated the possibility to expand the drifters data using trajectories of GPS-buoy equipped drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). The observed and simulated trajectories were compared in terms of spatial distribution, velocity distribution and a nondimensional skill score. For the drifters and FADs, the GlobCurrent and OSCAR products lead to similar performances as the CROCO model-ouputs in the broad studied domain. In the Gulf of Guinea, however, the CROCO model performed significantly better than the other two because the parent solution of CROCO benefited from its communication with a child grid of finer resolution in this region. On average, the simulations lead to an underestimation of the drifter and FAD velocities, likely because the spatial resolutions of the forcing products were insufficient and the time frequency at which they were produced were too low to resolve the relevant oceanic processes properly. We found a low skill for all models to simulate FAD trajectories, possibly because of the devices vertical structure that prevent FADs from drifting like water parcels. Our results therefore suggest that in the Tropical Atlantic the FAD dataset may not be appropriate to use for corroborating Lagrangian simulations."

The confluence of water masses on strong fronts promotes concentration of plankters (phytoplankton and small zooplankton) contributing to creation of oases in the oceanic desert for marine habitants, from small pelagic fish and turtles to seabirds and apex (top) predators. This article is a concise review of the role of ocean fronts in marine life, with a particular focus on their detection and tracking using satellite data and Lagrangian diagnostics. Using altimetry-based calculations of the indicators of water motion, it is shown how to identify circulation features with enhanced values of gradients of these indicators, the so-called Lagrangian fronts, which approximate locations of ocean fronts. The role of Lagrangian fronts, induced by horizontal stirring by large-scale currents, in structuring plankters and organizing spatial distribution of food resources in the open ocean is discussed as well. The paper emphasizes the importance of Lagrangian fronts in foraging strategy and as potential feeding grounds of pelagic fish, squid, seabirds, elephant seals, penguins and whales and their significance in marine ecology and fisheries."

The Lagrangian description of fluid motion is (usually) more mathematically demanding than the traditional Eulerian approach. However, it yields directly the mean particle drift velocity in periodic motion. The solution to the wave-drift problem in a Lagrangian description depends crucially on the viscosity <span class=""math""><math><mrow is=""true""><mi is=""true"">ν</mi></mrow></math></span> being non-zero, however small."

In the Lagrangian approach, large sets of virtual particles are integrated within the three-dimensional, time-evolving velocity fields. Over several decades, a variety of tools and methods for this purpose have emerged. Here, we review the state of the art in the field of Lagrangian analysis of ocean velocity data, starting from a fundamental kinematic framework and with a focus on large-scale open ocean applications. Beyond the use of explicit velocity fields, we consider the influence of unresolved physics and dynamics on particle trajectories. We comprehensively list and discuss the tools currently available for tracking virtual particles. We then showcase some of the innovative applications of trajectory data, and conclude with some open questions and an outlook. The overall goal of this review paper is to reconcile some of the different techniques and methods in Lagrangian ocean analysis, while recognising the rich diversity of codes that have and continue to emerge, and the challenges of the coming age of petascale computing."

We show that the concept of an LCS can be generalized to capture coherence in other quantities of interest that are transported by, but not fully locked to, the fluid. Such quantities include those with dynamic, biological, chemical, or thermodynamic relevance, such as temperature, pollutant concentration, vorticity, kinetic energy, plankton density, and so on. We provide a conceptual framework for identifying the Generalized Lagrangian Coherent Structures (GLCSs) associated with such evolving quantities. We show how LCSs can be seen as a special case within this framework, and provide an overarching discussion of various methods for identifying LCSs. The utility of this more general viewpoint is highlighted through a variety of examples. We also show that although LCSs approximate GLCSs in certain limiting situations under restrictive assumptions on how the velocity field affects the additional quantities of interest, LCSs are not in general sufficient to describe their coherent transport."

Additionally, it is widely recognised that eddies are prevalent in the EAC region – particularly south of the EAC separation."
6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661108000232,Statistics from Lagrangian observations,"We review statistical analyses of Lagrangian data from the ocean. These can be grouped into studies involving single particles and those with pairs or groups of particles. Single particle studies are the most common. The prevalent analysis involves binning velocities geographically to estimate the Eulerian means and lateral diffusivities. However single particle statistics have also been used to study Rossby wave propagation, the influence of bottom topography and eddy heat fluxes. Other studies have used stochastic models to simulate dispersion, calculated Lagrangian frequency spectra and examined the relation between Lagrangian and Eulerian integral scales. Studies involving pairs of particles are fewer, and the results are not well-established yet. There are indications that pair separations grow exponentially in time below the deformation radius, as is also the case in the stratosphere. The behavior at larger scales is less clear, indicating either a turbulent cascade or dispersion by the sheared large-scale circulation. In addition, three or more particles can be used to measure relative vorticity and divergence."

The motivation for this approach comes directly from advances in observational capabilities in oceanography (e.g., drifter deployments, remote sensing capabilities, satellite imagery, etc.) which reveal space–time structures that are highly suggestive of the structures one visualizes in the global, geometrical study of dynamical systems theory."

Here we review the emerging class of high-resolution global models that are simultaneously forced by both atmospheric fields and the astronomical tidal potential. Such models simulate barotropic (surface) tides, internal tides, near-inertial motions, the eddying general oceanic circulation, and a partially resolved internal gravity wave (IGW) continuum spectrum (Garrett-Munk spectrum) simultaneously. We review the technical aspects of such global models and their myriad applications, for example, in satellite oceanography, operational oceanography, boundary forcing of regional models, tidal-cryosphere interactions, and assessment of future coastal flooding hazards in a changing climate with altered tides."

However, climate models differ in their representation of the freshwater sources. Recent improvements in altimetry-based detection of small icebergs and in estimates of the mass loss of Antarctica may help better constrain the values of Antarctic freshwater releases. We propose a model-based seasonal climatology of iceberg melt over the Southern Ocean using state-of-the-art observed glaciological estimates of the Antarctic mass loss. An improved version of a Lagrangian iceberg model is coupled with a global, eddy-permitting ocean/sea ice model and compared to small icebergs observations. Iceberg melt increases sea ice cover, about 10% in annual mean sea ice volume, and decreases sea surface temperature over most of the Southern Ocean, but with distinctive regional patterns. Our results underline the importance of improving the representation of Antarctic freshwater sources. This can be achieved by forcing ocean/sea ice models with a climatological iceberg fresh-water flux."
10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500317301774,Will high-resolution global ocean models benefit coupled predictions on short-range to climate timescales?,"As the importance of the ocean in the weather and climate system is increasingly recognised, operational systems are now moving towards coupled prediction not only for seasonal to climate timescales but also for short-range forecasts. A three-way tension exists between the allocation of computing resources to refine model resolution, the expansion of model complexity/capability, and the increase of ensemble size. Here we review evidence for the benefits of increased ocean resolution in global coupled models, where the ocean component explicitly represents transient mesoscale eddies and narrow boundary currents. We consider lessons learned from forced ocean/sea-ice simulations; from studies concerning the SST resolution required to impact atmospheric simulations; and from coupled predictions. Impacts of the mesoscale ocean in western boundary current regions on the large-scale atmospheric state have been identified. Understanding of air-sea feedback in western boundary currents is modifying our view of the dynamics in these key regions. It remains unclear whether variability associated with open ocean mesoscale eddies is equally important to the large-scale atmospheric state. We include a discussion of what processes can presently be parameterised in coupled models with coarse resolution non-eddying ocean models, and where parameterizations may fall short. We discuss the benefits of resolution and identify gaps in the current literature that leave important questions unanswered."

The Global Ocean Observation System program designed a global array of 1250 drifter buoys to cover oceans at resolution of one per 5° × 5° grids spatially. The National Institute of Ocean Technology, India indigenized drifting buoy in 2012 with geostationary satellite communication to have near real-time data at every hour. The drifting buoy technology is applied for intellectual property right and transferred to Industries. The measurement scheme in the drifting buoys is capable to measure variability in sea surface temperature and small mesoscale surface eddies. This article describes case studies of indigenous drifting buoys in the Indian Ocean from 2012 onwards. The sea surface temperature and drifting speed measured with indigenous drifting buoy is compared with market available drifting buoy (Marlin-Yug), moored data buoy (BD11) and remote sensed data. We also report results from a drifting buoy with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) telemetry in the coastal region."

Monitoring how the ocean carbon cycle is changing is fundamental to managing climate change. Satellite remote sensing is currently our best tool for viewing the ocean surface globally and systematically, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and the past few decades have seen an exponential growth in studies utilising satellite data for ocean carbon research. Satellite-based observations must be combined with <em>in-situ</em> observations and models, to obtain a comprehensive view of ocean carbon pools and fluxes. To help prioritise future research in this area, a workshop was organised that assembled leading experts working on the topic, from around the world, including remote-sensing scientists, field scientists and modellers, with the goal to articulate a collective view of the current status of ocean carbon research, identify gaps in knowledge, and formulate a scientific roadmap for the next decade, with an emphasis on evaluating where satellite remote sensing may contribute. A total of 449 scientists and stakeholders participated (with balanced gender representation), from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Sessions targeted both inorganic and organic pools of carbon in the ocean, in both dissolved and particulate form, as well as major fluxes of carbon between reservoirs (e.g., primary production) and at interfaces (e.g., air-sea and land–ocean). Extreme events, blue carbon and carbon budgeting were also key topics discussed. Emerging priorities identified include: expanding the networks and quality of <em>in-situ</em> observations; improved satellite retrievals; improved uncertainty quantification; improved understanding of vertical distributions; integration with models; improved techniques to bridge spatial and temporal scales of the different data sources; and improved fundamental understanding of the ocean carbon cycle, and of the interactions among pools of carbon and light. We also report on priorities for the specific pools and fluxes studied, and highlight issues and concerns that arose during discussions, such as the need to consider the environmental impact of satellites or space activities; the role satellites can play in monitoring ocean carbon dioxide removal approaches; economic valuation of the satellite based information; to consider how satellites can contribute to monitoring cycles of other important climatically-relevant compounds and elements; to promote diversity and inclusivity in ocean carbon research; to bring together communities working on different aspects of planetary carbon; maximising use of international bodies; to follow an open science approach; to explore new and innovative ways to remotely monitor ocean carbon; and to harness quantum computing. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive scientific roadmap for the next decade on how satellite remote sensing could help monitor the ocean carbon cycle, and its links to the other domains, such as terrestrial and atmosphere."
13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661101000702,Remote sensing of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll during Lagrangian experiments at the Iberian margin,"Satellite derived sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll data are used to characterise the period of upwelling during a cruise on which two Lagrangian drift experiments were conducted off the Iberian Atlantic coast in August 1998. During the cruise there was a prolonged period of equator-ward winds which favour upwelling; three distinct maxima were observed in the meteorological data interspersed with periods of relaxation. The SST and chlorophyll imagery show upwelling to be active with distinct offshore filaments that are cooler and of higher chlorophyll concentration than the surrounding oceanic water; these filaments represent an important cross-shelf transport mechanism. A front detection methodology has been applied to satellite images and suggests that these filaments are distinct, long-lived features, characterised by enhanced primary production."
14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661101000696,"Vertical structure, turbulent mixing and fluxes during Lagrangian observations of an upwelling filament system off Northwest Iberia","In August 1998, a recurrent filament located near 42°N off Galicia was sampled as part of the OMEX-II project. Lagrangian and other observations were made on the shelf where the filament arose and offshore in the filament itself under upwelling favourable but fluctuating winds. The shelf drift experiment monitored a change from southward to weak northward net flow as the winds decreased to zero. Shipborne ADCP measurements showed that the shelf was supplying decreasing volumes of water to the filament as the wind speeds decreased. At the shelf edge the internal tide was larger than can be explained by local forcing and there were many unusually large high frequency internal waves with a quasi-sinusoidal form. Turbulence observations revealed enhanced dissipation rates and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients within the shelf thermocline (of order 1 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), which appeared to be caused by the breaking of internal wave. A second Lagrangian experiment was executed in the filament some 120 km offshore, which again coincided with a period of wind relaxation. Cross-sections revealed a double cold core and that the offshore flow was limited to a thin surface layer. Substantial onshore flow occurred below 50 m in the centre of the filament, while the strongest and deepest offshore flow coincided with its northern boundary. Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate measurements showed very weak mixing below 15 m in the filament core, but enhanced mixing at its boundaries. Four mixed layer drifters released in the filament initially indicated convergence at its southern boundary, marked by strong temperature and salinity contrasts. After the wind became more favourable for upwelling, the drifters accelerated. One drifter traced the full extent of the filament, while the other three escaped from it and began to circulate cyclonically over 28 days in a 100 km diameter loop back towards their release point. Although strong mesoscale activity linked the shelf and ocean regimes, offshore transport in the filament was weak at the time of the experiment and vertical and horizontal re-circulations on a variety of time scales were important. There was sufficient vertical mixing in the thermocline to cause it to thicken and draw some heat into the lower layers during the summer months on the shelf. The amount of heat involved was too little to have a significant impact on the development of a filament over a typical lifetime of a week."
15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661117301507,Biogeochemical and ecological impacts of boundary currents in the Indian Ocean,"Monsoon forcing and the unique geomorphology of the Indian Ocean basin result in complex boundary currents, which are unique in many respects. In the northern Indian Ocean, several boundary current systems reverse seasonally. For example, upwelling coincident with northward-flowing currents along the coast of Oman during the Southwest Monsoon gives rise to high productivity which also alters nutrient stoichiometry and therefore, the species composition of the resulting phytoplankton blooms. During the Northeast Monsoon most of the northern Indian Ocean boundary currents reverse and favor downwelling. Higher trophic level species have evolved behavioral responses to these seasonally changing conditions. Examples from the western Arabian Sea include vertical feeding migrations of a copepod (<em>Calanoides carinatus</em>) and the reproductive cycle of a large pelagic fish (<em>Scomberomorus commerson</em>). The impacts of these seasonal current reversals and changes in upwelling and downwelling circulations are also manifested in West Indian coastal waters, where they influence dissolved oxygen concentrations and have been implicated in massive fish kills. The winds and boundary currents reverse seasonally in the Bay of Bengal, though the associated changes in upwelling and productivity are less pronounced. Nonetheless, their effects are observed on the East Indian shelf as, for example, seasonal changes in copepod abundance and zooplankton community structure. In contrast, south of Sri Lanka seasonal reversals in the boundary currents are associated with dramatic changes in the intensity of coastal upwelling, chlorophyll concentration, and catch per unit effort of fishes. Off the coast of Java, monsoon-driven changes in the currents and upwelling strongly impact chlorophyll concentrations, seasonal vertical migrations of zooplankton, and sardine catch in Bali Strait.</p><p id=""sp0015"">In the southern hemisphere the Leeuwin is a downwelling-favorable current that flows southward along western Australia, though local wind forcing can lead to transient near shore current reversals and localized coastal upwelling. The poleward direction of this eastern boundary current is unique. Due to its high kinetic energy the Leeuwin Current sheds anomalous, relatively high chlorophyll, warm-core, downwelling eddies that transport coastal diatom communities westward into open ocean waters. Variations in the Leeuwin transport and eddy generation impact many higher trophic level species including the recruitment and fate of rock lobster (<em>Panulirus cygnus)</em> larvae. In contrast, the transport of the Agulhas Current is very large, with sources derived from the Mozambique Channel, the East Madagascar Current and the southwest Indian Ocean sub-gyre. Dynamically, the Agulhas Current is upwelling favorable; however, the spatial distribution of prominent surface manifestations of upwelling is controlled by local wind and topographic forcing. Meanders and eddies in the Agulhas Current propagate alongshore and interact with seasonal changes in the winds and topographic features. These give rise to seasonally variable localized upwelling and downwelling circulations with commensurate changes in primary production and higher trophic level responses. Due to the strong influence of the Agulhas Current, many neritic fish species in southeast Africa coastal waters have evolved highly selective behaviors and reproductive patterns for successful retention of planktonic eggs and larvae. For example, part of the Southern African sardine (<em>Sardinops sagax</em>) stock undergoes a remarkable northward migration enhanced by transient cyclonic eddies in the shoreward boundary of the Agulhas Current.</p><p id=""sp0020"">There is evidence from the paleoceanographic record that these currents and their biogeochemical and ecological impacts have changed significantly over glacial to interglacial timescales. These changes are explored as a means of providing insight into the potential impacts of climate change in the Indian Ocean."

El Niño (EN) 1997–1998 and La Niña (LN) 1999–2000 are well reproduced, inducing large spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical properties at three coastal upwelling centers along the Peruvian coast (Chimbote 9.4°S, Callao 12.1°S, and Pisco 14°S). During EN, the upper limit of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) experiences an offshore displacement of, approximately, 60<!-- --> <!-- -->km and a deepening of, approximately, 150<!-- --> <!-- -->m when compared to neutral-ENSO conditions, thus ventilating the upper 100<!-- --> <!-- -->m of the water column. In contrast, during LN, the OMZ tongue outcrops over the continental shelf deoxygenating the water column at all locations. During LN, at the southernmost location, enhanced Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) induces a leaking of the coastal nutrient inventory by horizontally advecting nitrogen from the nearshore region into the oligotrophic ocean. This leads to a reduction of biological production in the coastal zone. During EN, nitrification is an order of magnitude larger than denitrification in supplying the nitrite coastal pool. During LN peak, nitrification is reduced by 80%, while denitrification becomes equally important, evidencing a coupling between these two oxygen-dependent processes. The nitrogen removal due to suboxic activity is mostly controlled by the Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation (Anammox) in the southern domain during neutral-ENSO conditions. Our results show that during EN, denitrification contributes with 60% of the total nitrogen removal. In contrast, Anammox contributes with 70% during LN. The outgassing of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), an intermediate product of denitrification, is reduced and enhanced during EN and LN, respectively, and it is strongly modulated by the spatiotemporal variability of oxygen in the environment."

First, some fundamental differences in the hydrodynamics of the coastal ocean, such as the large surface elevation variation compared to the mean water depth, are contrasted against large scale ocean dynamics. Then the hydrodynamic equations as they are used in coastal ocean models as well as in large scale ocean models are presented, including parameterisations for turbulent transports. As steps towards discretisation, coordinate transformations and spatial discretisations based on a finite-volume approach are discussed with focus on the specific requirements for coastal ocean models. As in large scale ocean models, splitting of internal and external modes is essential also for coastal ocean models, but specific care is needed when drying &amp; flooding of intertidal flats is included. As one obvious characteristic of coastal ocean models, open boundaries occur and need to be treated in a way that correct model forcing from outside is transmitted to the model domain without reflecting waves from the inside. Here, also new developments in two-way nesting are presented. Single processes such as internal inertia-gravity waves, advection and turbulence closure models are discussed with focus on the coastal scales. Some overview on existing hydrostatic structured-grid coastal ocean models is given, including their extensions towards non-hydrostatic models. Finally, an outlook on future perspectives is made."

It is capable of moving among the geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere. This flow of carbon is referred to as the Earth's carbon cycle. It is also intimately linked to the cycling of other elements and compounds. The ocean plays a fundamental role in Earth's carbon cycle, helping to regulate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The ocean biological carbon pump (OBCP), defined as a set of processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, is at the heart of the ocean carbon cycle. Monitoring the OBCP is critical to understanding how the Earth's carbon cycle is changing. At present, satellite remote sensing is the only tool available for viewing the entire surface ocean at high temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we review methods for monitoring the OBCP with a focus on satellites. We begin by providing an overview of the OBCP, defining and describing the pools of carbon in the ocean, and the processes controlling fluxes of carbon between the pools, from the surface to the deep ocean, and among ocean, land and atmosphere. We then examine how field measurements, from ship and autonomous platforms, complement satellite observations, provide validation points for satellite products and lead to a more complete view of the OBCP than would be possible from satellite observations alone. A thorough analysis is then provided on methods used for monitoring the OBCP from satellite platforms, covering current capabilities, concepts and gaps, and the requirement for uncertainties in satellite products. We finish by discussing the potential for producing a satellite-based carbon budget for the oceans, the advantages of integrating satellite-based observations with ecosystem models and field measurements, and future opportunities in space, all with a view towards bringing satellite observations into the limelight of ocean carbon research."
19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322716303966,"Benthic storms, nepheloid layers, and linkage with upper ocean dynamics in the western North Atlantic","Benthic storms are episodic periods of strong abyssal currents and intense, benthic nepheloid (turbid) layer development. In order to interpret the driving forces that create and sustain these storms, we synthesize measurements of deep ocean currents, nephelometer-based particulate matter (PM) concentrations, and seafloor time-series photographs collected during several science programs that spanned two decades in the western North Atlantic. Benthic storms occurred in areas with high sea-surface eddy kinetic energy, and they most frequently occurred beneath the meandering Gulf Stream or its associated rings, which generate deep cyclones, anticyclones, and/or topographic waves; these create currents with sufficient bed-shear stress to erode and resuspend sediment, thus initiating or enhancing benthic storms. Occasionally, strong currents do not correspond with large increases in PM concentrations, suggesting that easily erodible sediment was previously swept away. Periods of moderate to low currents associated with high PM concentrations are also observed; these are interpreted as advection of PM delivered as storm tails from distal storm events. Outside of areas with high surface and deep eddy kinetic energy, benthic nepheloid layers are weak to non-existent, indicating that benthic storms are necessary to create and maintain strong nepheloid layers. Origins and intensities of benthic storms are best identified using a combination of time-series measurements of bottom currents, PM concentration, and bottom photographs, and these should be coupled with water-column and surface-circulation data to better interpret the specific relations between shallow and deep circulation patterns. Understanding the generation of benthic nepheloid layers is necessary in order to properly interpret PM distribution and its influence on global biogeochemistry."

It is also projected to be commercialized widely and become a part of the industry that alters conventional energy technologies in the near future. However, wave energy technologies are not entirely yet developed and mature enough, so various criteria must be optimized to enter the energy market. In order to maximize the performance of wave energy converters (WECs) components, three challenges are mostly considered: Geometry, Power Take-off (PTO) parameters, and WECs’ layout. As each of such challenges plays a meaningful role in harnessing the maximum power output, this paper systematically reviews applied state-of-the-art optimization techniques, including standard, hybrid, cooperative, bi-level and combinatorial strategies. Due to the importance of fidelity and computational cost in numerical methods, we also discuss approaches to analyzing WECs interactions’ developments. Moreover, the benefits and drawbacks of the popular optimization methods applied to improve WEC parameters’ performance are summarized, briefly discussing their key characteristics. According to the scoping review, using a combination of bio-inspired algorithms and local search as a hybrid algorithm can outperform the other techniques in layout optimization in terms of convergence rate. A review of the geometry of WECs has emphasized the indispensability of optimizing and balancing design parameters with cost issues in multimodal and large-scale problems."
21,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661101000052,On the seasonal variability and eddies in the North Brazil Current: insights from model intercomparison experiments,"The time dependent circulation of the North Brazil Current is studied with three numerical ocean circulation models, which differ by the vertical coordinate used to formulate the primitive equations. The models are driven with the same surface boundary conditions and their horizontal grid-resolution (isotropic, 1/3° at the equator) is in principle fine enough to permit the generation of mesoscale eddies. Our analysis of the mean seasonal currents concludes that the volume transport of the North Brazil Current (NBC) at the equator is principally determined by the strength of the meridional overturning, and suggests that the return path of the global thermohaline circulation is concentrated in the NBC. Models which simulate a realistic overturning at 24°N of the order of 16–18 Sv also simulate a realistic NBC transport of nearly 35 Sv comparable to estimates deduced from the most recent observations. In all models, the major part of this inflow of warm waters from the South Atlantic recirculates in the zonal equatorial current system, but the models also agree on the existence of a permanent coastal mean flow to the north-west, from the equator into the Carribean Sea, in the form of a continuous current or a succession of eddies. Important differences are found between models in their representation of the eddy field. The reasons invoked are the use of different subgrid-scale parameterisations, and differences in stability of the NBC retroflection loop because of differences in the representation of the effect of bottom friction according to the vertical coordinate that is used. Finally, even if differences noticed between models in the details of the seasonal mean circulation and water mass properties could be explained by differences in the eddy field, nonetheless the major characteristics (mean seasonal currents, volume and heat transports) appears to be at first order driven by the strength of the thermohaline circulation."
22,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661103001460,Observations of the Labrador Sea eddy field,"This paper is an observational study of small-scale coherent eddies in the Labrador Sea, a region of dense water formation thought to be of considerable importance to the North Atlantic overturning circulation. Numerical studies of deep convection emphasize coherent eddies as a mechanism for the lateral transport of heat, yet their small size has hindered observational progress. A large part of this paper is therefore devoted to developing new methods for identifying and describing coherent eddies in two observational platforms, current meter moorings and satellite altimetry. Details of the current and water mass structure of individual eddy events, as they are swept past by an advecting flow, can then be extracted from the mooring data. A transition is seen during mid-1997, with long-lived boundary current eddies dominating the central Labrador Sea year-round after this time, and convectively formed eddies similar to those seen in deep convection modeling studies apparent prior to this time. The TOPEX / Poseidon altimeter covers the Labrador Sea with a loose “net” of observations, through which coherent eddies can seem to appear and disappear. By concentrating on locating and describing anomalous events in individual altimeter tracks, a portrait of the spatial and temporal variability of the underlying eddy field can be constructed. The altimeter results reveal an annual “pulsation” of energy and of coherent eddies originating during the late fall at a particular location in the boundary current, pinpointing the time and place of the boundary current-type eddy formation. The interannual variability seen at the mooring is reproduced, but the mooring site is found to be within a localized region of greatly enhanced eddy activity. Notably lacking in both the annual cycle and interannual variability is a clear relationship between the eddies or eddy energy and the intensity of wintertime cooling. These eddy observations, as well as hydrographic evidence, suggest an active role for boundary current dynamics in shaping the energetics and water mass properties of the interior region."

Oil fate and transport calculations of the model are significantly impacted by the droplet size distribution. Accuracy of the model predictions heavily depend on how well the model can calculate or represent oil droplet sizes. However, in early oil spill models, the importance of oil droplet size calculation has been overlooked and they used simple empirical formulas. In recent decades, there have been some significant improvements in understanding of oil droplet size calculations. Both experimental studies as well as numerical studies have been contributed to improve oil droplet size calculations. The traditional equilibrium models have been improved while droplet dynamics models provided a different dimension to the oil DSD calculations. Thus, at this stage it is important to review the existing studies and methods of oil droplet size calculation. The objective of this paper is to review the development of oil droplet size calculation in ocean oil spill models highlighting the recent improvements. Furthermore, this paper discusses the capabilities and limitations of different approaches in calculating oil droplet size distribution in both underwater and surface oil spill models and discuss their applicability to different situations. This study will provide a good guideline for future oil spill model developments to improve the oil droplet size calculations."

As GOMRI sunsets in its tenth year after the DWH oil spill, synthesis efforts recently took place to assess the accomplishments of the program. In this paper, we report on DWH modeling as part of GOMRI's Synthesis and Legacy effort. We compile a list of 330 published applications by GOMRI, the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA), and others studying the DWH oil spill and look at a wide range of subjects, tools, achievements, and integration with field research. We offer highlights and synthesis based on discussions and public webinars held in 2019 and 2020. We synthesize the significant achievements and advancements that have been made in integrating the various disciplines and domains from a modeling perspective. There was a large diversity of tools used, including at least 74 unique modeling systems. Most studies employed circulation models. These hydrodynamic models were often coupled to wave, river, and atmosphere models, as well as representations of high pressure physics and oil chemistry. Several research groups used Lagrangian transport models and statistical inference to track subsurface oil. Some coupled biophysical models were also employed to study oil fate and weathering, larval transport, biological effects, and population dynamics. In a few cases, such biophysical models were linked to marine populations and to humans through socioeconomics effects and ecosystem services. We consider models made for response planning and remediation, damage assessment, and restoration planning. There are relatively few socioeconomic or human health models, although those few examples make good use of biophysical modeling products. Our conclusions offer some insights on how the development of new tools has better prepared us for studying environmental management challenges in the Gulf of Mexico."

Nowadays numerical modeling has become one of the widely used tools for monitoring and predicting the transport and fate of MP in marine environments. Despite the growing body of research on numerical modeling of marine MP, the advantages and disadvantages of various modeling methods have not received systematic evaluation in published works. Important aspects such as parameterization schemes for MP behaviors, factors influencing MP transport, and proper configuration in beaching are essential for guiding researchers to choose proper methods in their work. For this purpose, we comprehensively reviewed the current knowledge on factors influencing MP transport, classified modeling approaches according to the governing equations, and summarized up-to-date parameterization schemes for MP behaviors. Critical factors such as vertical velocity, biofouling, degradation, fragmentation, beaching, and washing-off were reviewed in the frame of MP transport processes."

One hundred eighteen individual looping float trajectories (loopers) were identified, each consisting of two or more consecutive loops. Each looper was interpreted to be in a discrete eddy, and its characteristics were estimated from the float trajectory. The highest percentage of loopers occured at 700m in the Newfoundland Basin, where roughly half of the float data were in loopers, mostly cyclones. In the Gulf Stream region, approximately 20% of the float data recorded at 700m were in loopers, again mostly cyclones. Overall, 21% of 700m data and 6% of 2000m data were in loopers."

In the atmospheric boundary layer the waves act as roughness elements, influencing the turbulent flow and the vertical wind speed profile, and induce oscillatory motions in the airflow. Spray droplets from breaking wave crests enhance structure corrosion, and may lead to icing under low-temperature conditions. Below the water surface, the air-sea momentum flux and mechanical energy flux, mediated by the waves and wave-generated turbulence, affect the vertical profiles of ocean current, temperature, and salinity. Effects include modifying the structural forces and dynamics, and the movement and dispersion of marine organisms, pollutants, and air bubbles generated by breaking waves, with consequences for fouling, corrosion, and environmental impact. Measurement of relevant airflow and ocean dynamical variables is also challenging, as near the water surface it is often necessary to use instruments mounted on moving measurement platforms.</p><p id=""spar0010"">Modelling such boundary-layer effects is a complex task, as a result of feedbacks between the airflow, wave field, current field, and turbulence in the atmosphere and the ocean. We present results from a coupled model study of the North Sea and Norwegian Sea area. We employ a mesoscale atmosphere model (WRF) and a spectral wave model (WAM), running simultaneously and coupled using the open-source coupler MCEL which can interpolate between different model grids and time steps. To investigate the ocean boundary layer, one-dimensional model experiments were performed for an idealized Ekman layer and for locations in the North Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and the northern Pacific, using a version of the GOTM turbulence model, modified to take wave dynamics into account.</p><p id=""spar0015"">Results show how the wave field alters the ocean's aerodynamic roughness and the air–sea momentum flux, depending on the relation between the surface wind speed and the propagation speed of the wave crests (the wave age). These effects will feed back into the airflow, wind speed and turbulence profile in the boundary layer. The ocean dynamics experiments showed results which compare favourably with field observations from the LOTUS3 and PROVESS experiments in the north Atlantic and North Sea, and Ocean Weather Station Papa in the Pacific Ocean."

Likewise, most eggs and larvae of marine organisms are dispersed by oceanic currents. It was historically believed that the spatial scale at which dispersal occurs was orders of magnitude smaller for plants than for fish. However, recent empirical estimates of seed and larval dispersal suggest that these dispersal scales are more alike than previously thought. The modeling approaches used to simulate aerial and aquatic dispersal are also converging. Similar biophysical models are developed, in which outputs of Eulerian models simulating the main physical forcing mechanism (wind or currents) are used as inputs to Lagrangian models that include biological components (such as seed terminal velocity or larval vertical migration). These biophysical models are then used to simulate trajectories of the biological entities (seeds, larvae) in three dimensions. We reflect on these converging trends by first putting them into an historical perspective, and then by comparing the physical and biological processes represented in marine larva vs. terrestrial seed dispersal models, the data used for the models output corroboration, and the tools available to perform simulations. We conclude that this convergence offers the opportunity to bridge the gap between two scientific communities which are currently largely disconnected. More broadly, we also see our comparison across systems as a useful way to strengthen the links between aquatic and terrestrial ecology by sharing knowledge, methods, tools, and concepts."

Ecogenomic sensors are instruments that can autonomously collect biological samples and perform molecular analyses. This technology reduces logistical constraints on the length and duration of biological data collection. Autonomous, robotic performance of molecular assays shows particular promise in the field of public health. Recent applications include simultaneous detection of harmful algal species and fecal markers paired with same-day remote reporting of test results.

Direct measurements of oceanic electric fields can be easily converted to water velocities by application of a first order theory. This technique has been shown to obtain high quality velocities through instrumental advances and an accumulation of experience during the past decades. EM instruments have unique operational considerations and observe, for instance, vertically-averaged horizontal velocity (from stationary sensors) or vertical profiles of horizontal velocity (from expendable probes or autonomous profiling floats). The first order theory describes the dominant electromagnetic response, in which vertically-averaged and vertically-varying horizontal velocities are proportional to electric fields and electric currents, respectively. After discussions of the first order theory and deployment practices, operational capabilities are shown through recently published projects that describe stream-coordinate velocity structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, quickly-evolving overflow events in the Denmark Strait, and time-development of momentum input into the ocean from a hurricane.</p><p id=""sp015"">A detailed analysis of the Gulf Stream at its separation point from the continental slope serves as a case study for interpreting EM measurements, including the incorporation of geophysical knowledge of the sediment.

Following the termination of the CSK in 1979, each MS continued the work to advance ocean science. The results of scientific studies of the Kuroshio and its adjacent regions have been published by various experts including many from the MSs of the WESTPAC; however, to-date, there has been no systematic approach to the research of the Kuroshio and its adjacent regions.</p><p id=""sp0010"">This review considered the Kuroshio from the regional perspective of experts of the MSs, that is, from the perspectives of MSs, science, and the future prospects. Experts from each MS reviewed past activities and contributions and reviewed the knowledge gaps in the fields of physical, biological, and biogeochemical science. Many scientific questions remain regarding the path of the Kuroshio from south to north, as well as associated phenomena, including mesoscale eddies and fronts, the important roles of ocean variations in adjacent regions, and the different roles and mechanisms of air–sea interactions in low- and mid-latitude areas. Despite considerable effort by many biologists, substantial gaps remain in our biological knowledge of the region. The Kuroshio and its adjacent regions comprise one of the areas of the world with high biodiversity; however, there has been insufficient research into what is the cause of this high biodiversity. From a biogeochemical aspect, high-resolution spatiotemporal observations will be required to understand interactions with physical processes both in the Kuroshio region and in the marginal seas. It has been highlighted that long-term fixed-location observations will be needed to understand the key mechanisms of biogeochemical processes, particularly in relation to climate change.</p><p id=""sp0015"">Finally, the report summarized the future perspectives. Based on recognition of the current circumstances and with acknowledgment of the potential short-term future capabilities of MSs, the possible uses of new technologies and frameworks were discussed. Since the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which came into force in 1994, it has been difficult to conduct observations in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of other regional states. Thus, new frameworks and/or technologies will be needed to ensure the success of future studies of the Kuroshio."

A mean Gulf Stream which bifurcates between 55° and 45°W to feed the North Atlantic Current and a southern recirculation can be clearly identified. A weak interior Sverdrup flow is also suggested.

This review will explore the future of modern turbulence theory by tracing its history, which began in earnest with Kolmogorov’s 1941 analysis of turbulence cascade and inertial range [A.N. Kolmogorov, <em>Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR</em>, <strong>30</strong>, 299, (1941); <strong>32</strong>, 19, (1941)]. The 80th Anniversary of Kolmogorov’s landmark study is a welcome opportunity to survey the achievements and evaluate the future of the theoretical approach of turbulence research. Over the years, turbulence theories have been critically important in laying the foundation of our understanding of the nature of turbulent flows. In particular, the Direct Interaction Approximation (DIA) [R.H. Kraichnan, <em>J. Fluid Mech.</em>, <strong>5</strong>, 497 (1959)] and its subsequent development, known as the statistical closure approach, can be identified as perhaps the most profound single advancement. The remarkable success of the statistical closure has furnished a platform to study such essential concepts as the energy transfer process and interacting scales, and the roles of the straining and sweeping motions. More recently, the quasi-Lagrangian formulation of V. L’vov &amp; I. Procaccia and Kraichnan’s solvable passive scalar model provided powerful ways to explore another fundamental aspect of turbulent flows, the phenomena of intermittency, and the associated anomalous scaling exponents. In the meantime, the theory of fluid equilibria has been developed to describe the large-scale structures that can emerge from turbulent cascades of two-dimensional and geophysical flows at a later time. And yet, despite all these successes, analytical treatments suffer from mathematical complexities. As a result, the utility of theoretical approaches has been limited to relatively idealized flows. On the other hand, in recent decades, computational abilities and experimental facilities have reached an unprecedented scale. Looking beyond the horizon, the imminent deployment of exascale supercomputers will generate complete datasets of the entire flow field of key benchmark flows, allowing researchers to extract additional measurements concerning fully developed, complex turbulent flow fields far beyond those available from the statistical closure theories. Some other developments that could potentially influence the future course of turbulence theories include the advancement of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science; likely disruptions arising from the advent of quantum computation; and the increasingly prominent role of turbulence research in providing more accurate climate scientific data. Turbulence theorists can leverage these developments by asking the right questions and developing advanced, sophisticated frameworks that will be able to predict and correlate vast amounts of data from the other two components of the trinity."

This is a review of observations of intrusions and the results of comparisons of properties such as scale, slopes, microstructure activity, and fluxes with theoretical models. A summary of estimates of lateral heat fluxes indicates a wide range of lateral diffusivities. We conclude by noting that our present knowledge is insufficient to predict the structure, length-scales and lateral fluxes of thermohaline intrusions with confidence, and list a number of unresolved questions.

Euthecosomatous pteropods (holoplanktonic gastropods) represent an excellent sentinel for indicating exposure to anthropogenic OA because of the sensitivity of their aragonite shells to the OA conditions less favorable for calcification. However, an integration of observations, experiments and modelling efforts is needed to make accurate predictions of how these organisms will respond to future changes to their environment. Our understanding of the underlying organismal biology and life history is far from complete and must be improved if we are to comprehend fully the responses of these organisms to the multitude of stressors in their environment beyond OA. This review considers the present state of research and understanding of euthecosomatous pteropod biology and ecology of these organisms and considers promising new laboratory methods, advances in instrumentation (such as molecular, trace elements, stable isotopes, palaeobiology alongside autonomous sampling platforms, CT scanning and high-quality video recording) and novel field-based approaches (i.e. studies of upwelling and CO<sub>2</sub> vent regions) that may allow us to improve our predictive capacity of their vulnerability and/or resilience. In addition to playing a critical ecological and biogeochemical role, pteropods can offer a significant value as an early-indicator of anthropogenic OA. This role as a sentinel species should be developed further to consolidate their potential use within marine environmental management policy making."

Hydrodynamic studies form the basis for many oceanographic subjects, whether sediment transport, morphology, water quality, ecological and climate changes are being investigated. Hydrodynamic modelling of oceans and coastal seas has become a fundamental tool for describing the dynamics of marine environments, revealing the human impact on the sea and promoting sustainable development of marine resources. By complementing – through data assimilation – more and more diffuse and integrated global and regional observing systems (composed of coastal gauges, moorings, buoys, satellites, drifters), hydrodynamic models provide a deterministic 4D view of the ocean state. In this context, the semi-enclosed Adriatic Sea represents a natural long-standing laboratory for hydrodynamic modelling. The peculiar historical, morphological and oceanographic characteristics of this basin and its complex coastline stimulated over decades the development and application of several ocean and coastal models. In this work, we review different aspects of hydrodynamic modelling covered by the literature, highlighting the wide variety of model applications carried out in the Adriatic Sea which could serve as examples for semi-enclosed, marginal and coastal seas worldwide. Within the scope of the review, we find that although significant progress has been made over the last few decades, most of the modelling studies underrate the importance of a detailed representation of the land-coastal-sea fluxes. We list a set of recommendations that can be used as guidelines for model implementation to broaden the applicability of hydrodynamic models in future studies. Finally, we discuss the remaining questions that still need to be further explored."

In the Somali Current section, we describe the ocean's responses to the summer and winter monsoon winds, and outline the modelling efforts that have been carried out to understand them. In the Bay of Bengal section, we present observational and modeling evidence showing the importance of remote forcing from the east, which to a large extent originates along the equator. In the following three sections, we review the southern-hemisphere subtropical regime and its associated boundary currents (<a class=""anchor u-display-inline anchor-paragraph"" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener=""true"" data-xocs-content-id=""SEC6"" data-xocs-content-type=""reference"" href=""#SEC6""><span class=""anchor-text"">Section 6</span></a>), the Indonesian Throughflow (<a class=""anchor u-display-inline anchor-paragraph"" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener=""true"" data-xocs-content-id=""SEC7"" data-xocs-content-type=""reference"" href=""#SEC7""><span class=""anchor-text"">Section 7</span></a>), the Red Sea and Persian Gulf circulations (<a class=""anchor u-display-inline anchor-paragraph"" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener=""true"" data-xocs-content-id=""SEC8"" data-xocs-content-type=""reference"" href=""#SEC8""><span class=""anchor-text"">Section 8</span></a>), and discuss aspects of their interactions with other Indian-Ocean circulations.

Model results show large seasonal variability of the meridional overturning streamfunction and heat flux, and we discuss possible physical mechanisms behind this variability. While the monsoon-driven variability of the deep cell is mostly a sloshing motion affecting heat storage, interesting water-mass transformations and monsoonal reversals occur in the shallow cross-equatorial cell. In the mean, the shallow cell connects the subduction areas in the southern subtropics and parts of the Indonesian Throughflow waters with the upwelling areas of the northern hemisphere via the cross-equatorial Somali Current. Its near-surface branch includes a shallow equatorial roll that is seasonally reversing. We close by looking at coupled ocean-climate anomalies, in particular the large events that were observed in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean in 1993/94 and 1997/98. These events have been interpreted as an independent Indian-Ocean climate mode by some investigators and as an ENSO-forced anomaly by others."

43,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661101000040,On the role of the Azores Current in the ventilation of the North Atlantic Ocean,"Three high-resolution ocean circulation models of the North Atlantic, differing chiefly in their description of the vertical coordinate, are used to examine the ventilation of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. All the models produce mode waters of realistic densities in the Sargasso Sea and the European Basin, but have Azores Currents of differing strengths, which are categorised as strong (of realistic transport), intermediate, and weak. These differences have a critical impact upon the ventilation of the gyre. Most importantly, the strong Azores Current forms an effective barrier to the southward ventilation of Eastern North Atlantic Water from the northern European Basin, initially driving it southwestwards into the central gyre, before turning it back eastwards again in a general cyclonic circulation north of the Current. The intermediate and weak Azores Currents instead allow the southward ventilation of this water mass near the European and African coasts. The situation in Nature appears to be intermediate between these two cases, with the Azores Current acting as a partial block. The study also raises the possibility of the Azores Current forming an advective connection between the Sargasso Sea Mode Waters in the western basin and modes of similar densities found in the eastern basin on the southern side of the Current. Although there are high levels of variability in the extent of these lighter modes in the eastern basin in Nature, this postulate is supported by a number of observational studies. In addition, the present study also provides some support for the local production of Madeira Mode Water in the eastern basin, associated with retroflecting current branches on the southern side of the Azores Current. Overall, the Azores Current is, therefore, likely to have a critical impact upon the ventilation of the subtropical gyre over a large area, rather than just locally, affecting the potential vorticity and density structure of the upper ocean between subtropical latitudes and the northern European Basin. The study also contributes to an ongoing community effort to assess the realism of our current generation of ocean models."
44,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661120302342,The surface salinity maximum of the South Atlantic,"Like most other ocean basins, the maximum sea surface salinity region (MSR) in the South Atlantic shows a large displacement from the region of maximum difference between evaporation and precipitation (E-P), suggesting that ocean processes play a key role in determining the location of the MSR. We use outputs from a general circulation model (ECCO v4r3) to analyze the mixed layer salinity balance and disentangle the interaction of atmospheric forcing and oceanic processes in both regions. The MSR balance is dominated by evaporative surface fluxes and entrainment, while advection and diffusion play a secondary role. On the other hand, in the region of maximum E-P, the high surface freshwater loss is partially compensated by horizontal advection of low salinity waters, which is responsible for decreasing the salinity below that observed in the MSR. Using a particle tracking model, we find that MSR waters originate mostly from re-circulation in the Tropical South Atlantic and from the Tropical North Atlantic and Indian Oceans. After reaching the MSR, most of those waters flow southward in austral summer along the Brazil Current (1."

The OWC is a widely studied Wave Energy Converter that provides a reliable form of renewable form of electricity that can potentially meet global energy needs. However, the fluid-flow phenomena affecting its hydrodynamic performance are not fully understood. While there has been the successful full-scale deployment of OWCs, various computational methods are being explored to optimize this technology. Potential flow theory is commonly used to evaluate the efficiency of OWCs; however, this assumption tends to over-predict the hydrodynamic performance. Recently, numerical studies using a diverse set of commercial, open-source, or in-house Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) using Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy Simulation codes show a better comparison to available experimental results but are computationally expensive. ANSYS Fluent was found to be the most widely used CFD code applied to the study of the OWCs, with a high degree of accuracy in terms of experimental validation of numerical results."

Here we focus on its use in addressing particle-pair statistics relevant to the quantification of turbulent collision rate of inertial particles. PPDNS is particularly useful as the interaction of particles with small-scale (dissipative) turbulent motion of the carrier flow is mostly relevant. Furthermore, since the particle size may be much smaller than the Kolmogorov length of the background fluid turbulence, a large number of particles are needed to accumulate meaningful pair statistics. Starting from the relative simple Lagrangian tracking of so-called ghost particles, PPDNS has significantly advanced our theoretical understanding of the kinematic formulation of the turbulent geometric collision kernel by providing essential data on dynamic collision kernel, radial relative velocity, and radial distribution function. A recent extension of PPDNS is a hybrid direct numerical simulation (HDNS) approach in which the effect of local hydrodynamic interactions of particles is considered, allowing quantitative assessment of the enhancement of collision efficiency by fluid turbulence. Limitations and open issues in PPDNS and HDNS are discussed. Finally, on-going studies of turbulent collision of inertial particles using large-eddy simulations and particle-resolved simulations are briefly discussed."

There is a corresponding scale of cognitive and sensory capability. Coupling hydrodynamic with Lagrangian particle modelling is well established, as is individual based modelling of animal behaviour. These areas have developed rapidly, due to availability of faster computers. These different disciplines have fundamentally different conceptual frameworks, but the combination of techniques offers an unparalleled opportunity to model swimming animals in water more accurately. More accurate models of dispersion, migration and other spatial dynamics would support a better informed ecosystem management and provide methods to define protected areas that are linked in coherent networks. Development plans for tidal power schemes and offshore wind farms mean that predictive models of migrating fish are needed urgently. Statistical models based on correlations become inaccurate as the environments move to previously unobserved states. This is where models based on rules such as individual based models have a unique advantage. I briefly review Eulerian, Lagrangian, coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian water models, water quality models and individual based models of animal movements, navigation and interactive behaviour."

Field estimates via data assimilation meld observations and dynamics and provide an efficient means of representing the physical processes which influence biogeochemical, ecological, acoustical and other processes in the sea. High derivatives can be taken from dynamically adjusted fields. Thus balance of terms in model equations is possible, which allows the inference of dynamical processes from observations via the quantitative study of energy and vorticity budgets, productivity rates, etc. A general discussion of processes and methodology is followed by a detailed review of the ocean forecast system developed at Harvard University.

Discharge of the turbulent jet through an ocean outfall can be modeled as a jet discharged in the wave environment. Effective dilution of the turbulent jet in the wave environment is important in order to minimize pollution of the marine environment. Dilution of the waste water jet in the wave environment can be estimated with the help of various fundamental properties (mean and turbulence quantities) of the jet. In this article, various mean and turbulence quantities of the jet in the regular and random wave environment are first identified from literature. Influence of regular and random waves on the mean properties of the jet such as velocity decay coefficient, jet width and axial velocity profile and turbulence quantities such as axial, lateral turbulence intensity and Reynolds shear stresses are then analyzed in detail based on review of literature. Outcomes of the present study indicate that the ratio of the jet inlet velocity to the wave orbital velocity emerges as a most important parameter in order to understand overall behavior of the jet. The behavior of the jet can be predicted in advance based on the ratio of the jet inlet velocity to the wave orbital velocity."

The circulation in the SCS is endowed with a distinctive multi-layer structure, which is influenced by the seasonally reversing Southeast Asian monsoon at the surface, modulated Kuroshio intrusion in the upper layer, and enhanced diapycnal mixing and persistent Luzon Strait deepwater overflow in the deep layer. After being diapycnally mixed by energetic internal tides, internal waves, and mesoscale eddies, waters entering the SCS in the upper and deep layers through the Luzon Strait are returned to the northwestern Pacific in the intermediate layer. This inflow-outflow-inflow structure in vertical induces net inflows of potential vorticity in the upper and deep layers and a net outflow of potential vorticity in the intermediate layer of the Luzon Strait, which are believed to be closely related with the circulation structure in the SCS. A sandwiched circulation in the SCS, namely, anticyclonic in the intermediate layer and cyclonic in the upper and deeper layers, was recently reported, but controversial issues still remain on its spatial pattern and temporal variability. To ascertain this sandwiched circulation and reveal its driving mechanism is of much scientific interest to the on-going discussion on the SCS circulation and its role in regional climate. Different from previous review articles focusing on eddies or circulation in a specific layer or area, we overview the <em>full-depth circulation of the SCS layer-by-layer</em> and outline its possible forcing mechanisms, and furthermore, provide perspectives for further investigation."

The formation and crystallization of magma oceans could be a defining stage in the assembly of a core, origin of a crust, initiation of tectonics, and formation of an atmosphere. The last decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of this phenomenon through analysis of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples, planetary missions, and astronomical observations of exoplanets. This review describes the energetic basis of magma oceans and lava worlds and the lava lake analogs available for study on Earth and Io. It provides an overview of evidence for magma oceans throughout the Solar System and considers the factors that control the rocks these magma oceans leave behind. It describes research on theoretical and observed exoplanets that could host extant magma oceans and summarizes efforts to detect and characterize them. It reviews modeling of the evolution of magma oceans as a result of crystallization and evaporation, the interaction with the underlying solid mantle, and the effects of planetary rotation. The review also considers theoretical investigations on the formation of an atmosphere in concert with the magma ocean and in response to irradiation from the host star, and possible end-states. Finally, it describes needs and gaps in our knowledge and points to future opportunities with new planetary missions and space telescopes to identify and better characterize lava worlds around nearby stars."

To do so, we have developed a coupled modeling system composed of linked regional and global circulation models. The regional model, configured with 13–22 km resolution in the CGOA, is forced at the surface by observed heat fluxes and wind stresses, at the continental boundaries by observed runoff, and at the open ocean boundaries by a combination of tracer climatologies and sub-tidal velocity and tidal elevation provided by a global finite element model. In this communication, we describe the coupled system, including its present method of intermodel coupling, describe a series of multi-year model hindcasts, compare hindcast results with Eulerian and Lagrangian field data obtained in the CGOA in fall 1996, and assess the impact of global information (barotropic sub-tidal velocities and tidal elevations) on the regional model under the present coupling strategy. We find that the regional model produces appropriate current systems (Alaskan Stream, Alaska Coastal Current) and scalar fields, but with mesoscale variability (of SSH and velocities) at somewhat reduced strength relative to data, and with temperature gradients somewhat larger than those observed. Barotropic sub-tidal information from the global model penetrates the regional model interior, supplying additional mesoscale variability, and modifying regional velocity and scalar fields in both shallow and deep areas. Tidal information exerts a significant influence on sub-tidal scalar and velocity structure only in specific shallow areas, where the tides (and tidal mixing) are strongest. Pending the exploration of alternate coupling schemes, we infer from these results that on a time scale of months, purely barotropic information from outside the CGOA will have a modest impact on its mean regional circulation, but a potentially stronger impact on the statistics and details of mesoscale eddies."

Up to now, the technologies that have been developed for this purpose include seawater air-conditioning, surface water heat pump, and ocean energy thermal conversion systems or their combinations, which are presented here as Waterbodies Thermal Energy Based Systems (WTEBSs). The growth and development of these technologies raise concerns regarding their potential impacts on sustainability of the marine environment. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the available literature and state-of-the-art technologies describing potential interactions of WTEBSs throughout their life-cycle (i.e. including construction, installation, operation, and decommissioning) with the marine ecology. Modelling of seawater discharge dispersion as one of the main environmental impact concerns regarding the operation of WTEBSs is detailed and scopes for improving existing modelling tools are discussed. Potential destructive impacts of fouling and corrosion in WTEBSs are reported and deterrent recommendations are highlighted. Evidence of growth of bio-fouling inside of pipelines and associated mesh filtration baskets at abstraction pipe intakes are presented. The required permitting applications and licensing processes for installation and operation of WTEBSs by the relevant authorities are summarised.

The focus of this paper is on physical processes, and we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art based on presentations and discussions at the meeting, which revolved around the four primary themes of parameterizations, numerical methods, in-situ and remote-sensing measurements, and high-performance computing. A primary outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to reduce subjectivity and improve reproducibility in modeling of physical processes in the coastal ocean. Reduction of subjectivity can be accomplished through development of standards for benchmarks, grid generation, and validation, and reproducibility can be improved through development of standards for input/output, coupling and model nesting, and reporting. Subjectivity can also be reduced through more engagement with the applied mathematics and computer science communities to develop methods for robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Such engagement could be encouraged through more collaboration between the forward and inverse modeling communities and integration of more applied math and computer science into oceanography curricula. Another outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to develop high-resolution models that scale on advanced HPC systems to resolve, rather than parameterize, processes with horizontal scales that range between the depth and the internal Rossby deformation scale. Unsurprisingly, more research is needed on parameterizations of processes at scales smaller than the depth, including parameterizations for drag (including bottom roughness, bedforms, vegetation and corals), wave breaking, and air–sea interactions under strong wind conditions. Other topics that require significantly more work to better parameterize include nearshore wave modeling, sediment transport modeling, and morphodynamics. Finally, it was agreed that coastal models should be considered as key infrastructure needed to support research, just like laboratory facilities, field instrumentation, and research vessels. This will require a shift in the way proposals related to coastal ocean modeling are reviewed and funded."

Marine microplastics predominantly originate near the coast and can remain in the nearshore zone for some time. However, at present, there is little understanding of the fate and transport of microplastics in coastal regions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the physical processes involved in the movement of microplastics from estuaries to the continental shelf. The trajectory and speed of microplastics are controlled by their physical characteristics (density, size, and shape) and ocean dynamic conditions (wind, waves, tides, thermohaline gradients, and the influence of benthic sediments). Microplastic particles can be subjected to beaching, surface drifting, vertical mixing, and biofouling, as well as bed-load and suspended load transport processes, until reaching terminal deposition on beaches, in coastal marshes, in benthic sediments or until they are carried by ocean currents to subtropical convergence zones. The dynamic interaction of released microplastics with the shoreline is regulated by onshore/offshore transport, which is impacted by the source location as well as the geometry, vegetation, tidal regime, and wave direction. Wind and wave conditions dominate surface drifting of buoyant particles through Ekman drift, windage, and Stokes drift mechanisms. Neustic microplastic particles travel in the subsurface because of vertical mixing through wind-driven Langmuir circulation and heat cycling. Increasing accumulation of microplastics in benthic sediments needs to be quantitatively explored in terms of biofouling, deposition, entrainment, and transport dynamics. Further studies are required to understand the following: 1) the primary parameters (e.g., windage, terminal velocity, diffusivity, critical shear stress) that determine microplastic transport in different pathways; 2) dynamic distribution of microplastics in various coastal landscapes (e.g., wetlands, beaches, estuaries, lagoons, barrier islands, depocenters) regulated by hydrodynamic conditions; and 3) interactions between the physical transport processes and biochemical reactions (degradation, flocculation, biofouling, ingestions)."

In particular, extensive research in sedimentology can provide valuable insights to guide future microplastics research. To advance our understanding of the comparability of natural sediments with microplastics, we take an interdisciplinary look at the existing literature describing particle properties, transport processes, sampling techniques and ecotoxicology. Based on our analysis, we define seven research goals that are essential to improve our understanding of microplastics and can be tackled by learning from natural sediment research, and identify relevant tasks to achieve each goal. These goals address (1) the description of microplastic particles, (2) the interaction of microplastics with environmental substances, (3) the vertical distribution of microplastics, (4) the erosion and deposition behaviour of microplastics, (5) the impact of biota on microplastic transport, (6) the sampling methods and (7) the microplastic toxicity. When describing microplastic particles, we should specifically draw from the knowledge of natural sediments, for example by using shape factors or applying methods for determining the principal dimensions of non-spherical particles. Sediment transport offers many fundamentals that are transferable to microplastic transport, and could be usefully applied. However, major knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the role of transport modes, the influence of biota on microplastic transport, and the importance and implementation of the dynamic behaviour of microplastics as a result of time-dependent changes in particle properties in numerical models. We give an overview of available sampling methods from sedimentology and discuss their suitability for microplastic sampling, which can be used for creating standardised guidelines for future application with microplastics. In order to comprehensively assess the ecotoxicology of microplastics, a distinction must be made between the effects of the polymers themselves, their physical form, the plastic-associated chemicals and the attached pollutants. This review highlights areas where we can rely on understanding and techniques from sediment research - and areas where we need new, microplastic-specific knowledge - and synthesize recommendations to guide future, interdisciplinary microplastic research."

Its spatial variability and dynamics are described from a multivariate analysis of AXBT, CTD and ADCP data collected during the mesoscale experiment FE-91 (May 22 – June 2, 1991). The results provide evidence of two energetic frontal jets that drive the circulation over the slopes: the southward Continental current (0.9Sv) and the northward Balearic current (0.5Sv). In the southern Balearic basin, to the north of the Ibiza sill, the analyses show that the slope circulation is drastically modified by a wide pool (≈70km) of Winter Intermediate Waters (WIW). In this region, both the Continental and Balearic currents leave the slopes and merge offshore. As a result, the Continental current veers cyclonically to the north and flows along the insular slope. Numerous mesoscale structures (eddies, meanders and filaments) are found in the centre of the basin, directly related to instabilities of the frontal jets often induced by sharp topographic irregularities and subsurface eddies, and involving significant offshore transport of slope waters. Assuming stationarity of the velocity field, a Lagrangian integration is performed to establish the trajectories and time scales associated with the analysed velocity field. The calculations indicate that a drifter released in the core of the Continental current at 22m depth drifts cyclonically around the Balearic basin and reaches the north of Mallorca in less than 40 days. This is consistent with data from an <em>in situ</em> surface drifter deployed in June 1993, and suggests that the velocity field obtained from FE-91 data is representative of the summer circulation of the Balearic Sea. All these results are discussed in the perspective of the general circulation of the Western Mediterranean."

We conclude by proposing a set of candidate ocean observing missions with an emphasis on radar-based observations, with a focus on Synthetic Aperture Radar."

However unlike in the development of the reaction turbines, where Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) have been successfully applied for more than 20 years now, up until recently it was not feasible to perform CFD analysis of Pelton turbines due to the nature of the flow which is much more complex than in the reaction turbines. The recent developments in CFD models and tools together with the continuous increase in computational resource are bringing the CFD modelling up to a level suitable for industrial applications in development of Pelton turbines. Current published research in the field worldwide can be divided into two distinct branches of CFD models: the Eulerian specification of flow field, which tends to be more accurate, but also more computationally expensive, and the Lagrangian specification which is known to be less computationally demanding, however to date it cannot compete with Eulerian specification in terms of accuracy. This review paper is aiming at establishing the state of the art in numerical modelling of Pelton Turbines and would serve as guidance when choosing the optimum CFD modelling methodology and software available."

One of the competing scenarios proposed for the termination of this environmental crisis 5.3 million years ago consists of a megaflooding event refilling the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar: the Zanclean flood. The main evidence supporting this hypothesis is a nearly 390 km long and several hundred meters deep erosion channel extending from the Gulf of Cádiz (Atlantic Ocean) to the Algerian Basin (Western Mediterranean), implying the excavation of ca. 1000 km<sup>3</sup> of Miocene sediment and bedrock. Based on the understanding obtained from Pleistocene onshore megaflooding events and using ad-hoc hydrodynamic modeling, here we explore two predictions of the Zanclean outburst flood hypothesis: 1) The formation of similar erosion features at sills communicating sub-basins within the Mediterranean Sea, specifically at the Sicily Sill; and 2) the accumulation of the eroded materials as megaflood deposits in areas of low flow energy. Recent data show a 6-km-wide amphitheater-shaped canyon preserved at the Malta Escarpment that may represent the erosional expression of the Zanclean flood after filling the western Mediterranean and spilling into the Eastern Basin. Next to that canyon, a ~1600 km<sup>3</sup> accumulation of chaotic, seismically transparent sediment has been found in the Ionian Sea, compatible in age and facies with megaflood deposits. Another candidate megaflood deposit has been identified in the Alborán Sea in the form of elongated sedimentary bodies that parallel the flooding channel and are seismically characterized by chaotic and discontinuous stratified reflections, that we interpret as equivalent to gravel and boulder megabars described in terrestrial megaflood settings."

Ongoing developments in estimating rapid contaminant dispersion include the combined use of local meteorological data along with plume-source localization and identification via autonomous data-driven mobile-sensing robotic/vehicular platforms. With a vast number of available environmental-sensing mobile platforms, contaminant dispersion scenarios, and source-finding algorithms, selection of the ideal configuration for autonomous source localization involves a great deal of opportunity alongside uncertainty. This paper aims to review the significant developments of unmanned ground-based mobile sensing network configurations and autonomous data acquisition strategies commonly used for the task of gaseous plume source localization."
73,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825216303117,"Rip current types, circulation and hazard","Rip currents are narrow and concentrated seaward-directed flows that extend from close to the shoreline, through the surf zone, and varying distances beyond. Rip currents are ubiquitous on wave-exposed coasts. Each year they cause hundreds of drowning deaths and tens of thousands of rescues on beaches worldwide and are therefore the leading deadly hazard to recreational beach users. The broad definition above masks considerable natural variability in terms of rip current occurrence in time and space, flow characteristics and behaviour. In particular, surf-zone rip currents have long been perceived as narrow flows extending well beyond the breakers, flushing out the surf zone at a high rate (‘exit flow’ circulation regime), while more recent studies have shown that rip flow patterns can consist of quasi-steady semi-enclosed vortices retaining most of the floating material within the surf zone (‘circulatory flow’ circulation regime). Building upon a growing body of rip current literature involving numerical modelling and theory together with emergence of dense Lagrangian field measurements, we develop a robust rip current type classification that provides a relevant framework to understand the primary morphological and hydrodynamic parameters controlling surf-zone rip current occurrence and dynamics. Three broad categories of rip current types are described based on the dominant controlling forcing mechanism. Each category is further divided into two types owing to different physical driving mechanisms for a total of six fundamentally different rip current types: hydrodynamically-controlled (1) shear instability rips and (2) flash rips, which are transient in both time and space and occur on alongshore-uniform beaches; bathymetrically-controlled (3) channel rips and (4) focused rips, which occur at relatively fixed locations and are driven by hydrodynamic processes forced by natural alongshore variability of the morphology in both the surf zone and inner shelf zone; and boundary-controlled (5) deflection rips and (6) shadow rips, which flow against rigid lateral boundaries such as natural headlands or anthropogenic structures. For each rip current type, flow response to changes in hydrodynamic and morphologic forcing magnitude is examined in regard to velocity modulation and changes in circulation regime, providing key force-response relationships of rip currents. We also demonstrate that in the real world, rip currents form through a mixture of driving mechanisms and the discrete rip types defined in fact form key elements in a wide and complex spectrum of rip currents on natural beaches. It is anticipated that this rip current type classification will serve as a resource for coastal scientists and non-specialists with an interest in the rip current hazard, and as a platform for future rip current studies. Finally, we suggest some important future research directions highlighting the need for coastal and beach safety communities to collaborate in order to improve rip current education and awareness."

This wide size range makes dust a unique aerosol species with the ability to interact with many aspects of the Earth system, including radiation, clouds, hydrology, atmospheric chemistry, and biogeochemistry. This review focuses on coarse and super-coarse dust aerosols, which we respectively define as dust particles with a diameter of 2.5–10 µm and 10–62.5 µm. We review several lines of observational evidence indicating that coarse and super-coarse dust particles are transported farther than previously expected and that the abundance of these particles is substantially underestimated in current global models. We synthesize previous studies that used observations, theories, and model simulations to highlight the impacts of coarse and super-coarse dust aerosols on the Earth system, including their effects on dust-radiation interactions, dust-cloud interactions, atmospheric chemistry, and biogeochemistry. Specifically, coarse and super-coarse dust aerosols produce a net positive direct radiative effect (warming) at the top of the atmosphere and can modify temperature and water vapor profiles, influencing the distribution of clouds and precipitation. In addition, coarse and super-coarse dust aerosols contribute a substantial fraction of ice-nucleating particles, especially at temperatures above –23 °C. They also contribute a substantial fraction to the available reactive surfaces for atmospheric processing and the dust deposition flux that impacts land and ocean biogeochemistry by supplying important nutrients such as iron and phosphorus. Furthermore, we examine several limitations in the representation of coarse and super-coarse dust aerosols in current model simulations and remote-sensing retrievals. Because these limitations substantially contribute to the uncertainties in simulating the abundance and impacts of coarse and super-coarse dust aerosols, we offer some recommendations to facilitate future studies. Overall, we conclude that an accurate representation of coarse and super-coarse properties is critical in understanding the impacts of dust aerosols on the Earth system."

First, water wave theory is described beginning with the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. A variety of wave theories are discussed, beginning with linearized wave theory, and continuing with Stokes, cnoidal and solitary wave theory. The regions of wave applicability for different theories are shown, summarizing the discussion of water wave theory. Following the introduction of water wave theory, ocean physics is introduced. This section includes ocean wave generation, random waves, spectral representation and commonly used wave spectra, including the Pierson–Moskowitz and JONSWAP spectra. Next, wave–body interaction is presented, first looking at static and then dynamic loads. The dynamic load discussion covers waves, added mass and impulse loads. The section on wave–body interaction concludes with a review of recent literature on wave–body interactions, with emphasis on offshore wind energy. Additionally, a sample of existing engineering tools for modeling hydrodynamics on offshore wind turbines is presented. Finally, finite volume methods are presented to lay the groundwork for reviewing recent computational fluid dynamics research relating to the wave–body interaction problem. The review culminates in a review of recent CFD research."

We argue that the method is purely classical in nature, being nothing more than a mathematical statement of the principles upon which nearly all previous circulation schemes have been based. The ‘smoothed’ solution is shown to represent the components of the flow field that are determinable independently of the initial reference level. We then produce two circulation schemes based upon two different initial reference levels — 2000 decibars and the bottom — called North Atlantic-1A and North Atlantic-1B respectively. The models share many features in common and are strikingly similar to several previous schemes, most notably those of Jacobsen and Defant in the region west of Bermuda. No simple level-of-no-motion emerges in the flow fields; rather the velocity sections exhibit a complex cellular structure. Zonally integrated meridional cells of models and of the uniquely determined components are very similar, showing a poleward movement of warm saline water compensated at depth by a return flow of cold, fresher water. The magnitudes of the implied polar sea overflows and the heat fluxes are in good agreement with previous estimates. Finally, it is argued that neither these model circulations nor any other circulation pattern based upon the existing data can be regarded as actually representing the true time average ocean circulation because the data are aliased in time; the frequency/wavenumber spectrum of the ocean is inadequately known to determine the resulting errors."

Traditionally, most applications have been to organisms at higher trophic levels, where the importance of population heterogeneity (intra-population variability), complete life cycles and behavior adapted to internal and external conditions has been recognized for some time. However, advances in molecular biology and biochemistry have brought about an increase in the application of individual-based modeling (IBM) to microbes as well. This literature review summarizes 46 IBM papers for bacteria in wastewater treatment plants, phytoplankton in ocean and inland waters, bacteria in biofilms, bacteria in food and other environs, and “digital organisms” and “domesticated computer viruses” <em>in silico</em>. The use of IBM in these applications was motivated by population heterogeneity (45%), emergence (24%), absence of a continuum (5%), and other unknown reasons (26%). In general, the challenges and concepts of IBM modeling for microbes and higher trophic levels are similar. However, there are differences in the microbe population dynamics and their environment that create somewhat different challenges, which have led to somewhat different modeling concepts. Several topics are discussed, including producing, maintaining and changing population heterogeneity (different life histories, internal variability, positive feedback, inter-generation memory), dealing with very large numbers of individuals (different up-scaling methods, including representative space vs. super-individual, number vs. biomass based, discrete vs. continuous kinetics, various agent accounting methods), handling space, simulating interactions with the extracellular environment (hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian approach), modeling agent–agent interaction (self-shading, predation, shoving) and passive transport (random walk with spatially variable diffusivity, well-mixed reactors). Overall, the literature indicates that the application of IBM to microbes is developing into a mature field. However, several challenges remain, including simulating various types of agent–agent interactions (formation and function of colonies or filaments, sexual reproduction) and even smaller individuals (viruses, genes). Further increases in intracellular detail and complexity in microbe IBMs may be considered the combination of systems biology and systems ecology, or the new field of systems bioecology."

The development and spatiotemporal distributions of blooms are governed by complex physical mixing and transport processes that interact with physiological processes affecting the growth and loss of bloom-forming species. Individual-based models (IBMs) can provide a valuable tool for exploring and integrating some of these processes. Here we contend that the advantages of IBMs have not been fully exploited. The main reasons for the lack of progress in mainstreaming IBMs in numerical modelling are their complexity and high computational demand. In this review, we identify gaps and challenges in the use of IBMs for modelling CyanoHABs and provide an overview of the processes that should be considered for simulating the spatial and temporal distributions of cyanobacteria. Notably, important processes affecting cyanobacteria distributions, in particular their vertical passive movement, have not been considered in many existing lake ecosystem models. We identify the following research gaps that should be addressed in future studies that use IBMs: 1) effects of vertical movement and physiological processes relevant to cyanobacteria growth and accumulations, 2) effects and feedbacks of CyanoHABs on their environment; 3) inter and intra-specific competition of cyanobacteria species for nutrients and light; 4) use of high resolved temporal-spatial data for calibration and verification targets for IBMs; and 5) climate change impacts on the frequency, intensity and duration of CyanoHABs. IBMs are well adapted to incorporate these processes and should be considered as the next generation of models for simulating CyanoHABs."

Industry has proposed many technologies and, based on their working principle, these technologies generally can be categorized into oscillating water columns, point absorbers, overtopping systems, and bottom-hinged systems. In particular, many researchers have focused on modeling the point absorber, which is thought to be the most cost-efficient technology to extract wave energy. To model such devices, several modeling methods have been used such as analytical methods, boundary integral equation methods and Navier–Stokes equation methods. The first two are generally combined with the use of empirical solution to represent the viscous damping effect, while the last one is directly included in the solution. To assist the development of wave energy conversion (WEC) technologies, this paper extensively reviews the methods for modeling point absorbers."

This has a significant effect not only on marine biodiversity, but also on public safety and numerous infectious diseases found in both aquatic and human species. A huge amount of money was spent worldwide on plastic waste. In the 1940s, plastics development began and is increasing massively. This crucial analysis intends to accomplish goals such as defining plastic materials, origins, detecting aggregation, and validating appropriate techniques to analyze plastic abundance spatio-temporal trends. This further addresses the possible impacts of plastics on marine species, humans, and future chemical emission control strategies together with advice. Plastics are primarily distributed along the coasts and mid-ocean vortex in large amounts. The broad variety of plastics, as eaten by aquatic animals finds their way to the human body through the food chain. Research articles should help learn the origins, deterioration mechanisms, and harmful effects of plastics on both the human body and the ecosystem. Until recently, the science community and politicians have generally ignored plastic waste, but ecological implications, as well as plastic pollution’s economic/health effects, have now gained greater global interest."

This review examines the fluid-structure interactions, between structures and organisms, within cage-based aquaculture. Using data from previous research, we list and classify aquaculture cages into net-cage and closed-cage systems. Net-cage aquaculture systems are classified with regards to their submergence, materials and aperture shapes of nets. Then, the comparison is made between the research methods used to assess the interactions between environmental loads and aquaculture cages; this comparison includes analytical studies, numerical implementations, field tests and laboratory experiments. We also provide reviews of topics such as mooring and grid systems, drag coefficients of the net panel, hydrodynamic behaviours of cage components, velocity reduction of cage array and volume reduction caused by cage deformation. In particular, fish swimming behaviour is reviewed for designing new open ocean aquaculture systems. To support the further development of aquaculture engineering and technology, statistics, tables, formulae and figures are provided."

Open boundaries for this model were generated with a basin scale model covering major parts of the North Atlantic and nested in two steps into models with grid resolutions of 10 and 3.3km, respectively. The ecosystem model consists of eight state variables (nitrate, ammonium, silicate, diatoms, flagellates, meso- and microzooplankton, fast and slow sinking detritus) and assumes that nitrogen and silicate are the potential limiting nutrients. The primitive equation models produced coastal upwelling that injects nutrients into the euphotic zone in response to northerly wind forcing. Filaments were formed when the upwelling favourable wind peaked in July/August. High primary production was found on the shelf and in the core of the upwelling filaments. The simulations used atmospheric input from 1998 allowing comparison with a Lagrangian experiment in August 1998. The ecological model, having the same structure as a model been applied on boreal shelves, gave good simulations of the carbon flux on and off the Iberian margin. However, some stocks and rates of carbon were not well validated with the data from the field investigation. The simulated net export of carbon from May to September across the 400km long, 200m isobath is estimated to be 4.4×10<sup>11</sup>gC or 6.3mgC m<sup>−2</sup>.s<sup>−1</sup>."

Finally, despite the pioneering work of predecessors, there are still challenges to overcome. According to the actual sea conditions, flow field variations, and algorithm applications, the discussion section analyzes the influence of external conditions, the effect of internal sloshing on ships, and the advantages and disadvantages of some algorithms.

A variety of complementary, multiannual observational records have revealed Earth-like cycling of dust and water through the Mars system, as well as hints of dynamical coupling between the lower, middle, and upper atmosphere involving deep convection, planetary waves, thermal tides, and gravity waves that can be analogous to, but sometimes very different from, coupling processes in the Earth's atmosphere. This review focuses on several essential coupling processes on Mars involving the dust/water cycling and wave activity: (1) interaction between the dust cycle, water cycle and wave activity in the lower atmosphere; (2) the global meridional circulation and middle atmospheric polar warmings; and (3) vertical coupling throughout the atmosphere during dusty/non-dusty conditions. Most of these processes have been studied with state-of-the-art numerical models validated with recent observations. In addition, we summarize several newly proposed hypotheses that potentially impact our understanding of major issues in planetary science such as atmospheric coupling, water escape, or mesospheric cloud formation. We find many similarities between wave-induced couplings on Earth and Mars and analogies between the Earth's water cycle and Mars's dust cycle, which provide insights into comparative studies of these two planets."

Although there are reviews regarding microplastic debris in environments, most of them focus on the studies on their type, occurrence, and distribution. Only a limited number of these studies focus on the modeling methods, usually concentrating on particular aspects, such as settling or bioaccumulation. In this paper, physically-based existing microplastics modeling studies are classified and reviewed according to the environment, modeling methodology, and input-output relationships. Considering the strengths and weaknesses of all modeling methodologies, it is deduced that more reliable results are obtained using hybrid methods, especially the coupling of hydrodynamic and process-based models, and hydrodynamics and statistical models. The significance of having much more consideration and knowledge on the microplastics' physical properties and the environmental processes affecting their fate and transport in the aquatic environments is revealed for future research.

Of these, the Arctic sea ice regime has seen some of the most rapid change and is one of the most visible markers of Arctic change outside the scientific community. This has drawn considerable attention not only from the natural sciences, but increasingly, from the political and commercial sectors as they begin to grapple with the problems and opportunities that are being presented. The possible impacts of past and projected changes in Arctic sea ice, especially as it relates to climatic response, are of particular interest and have been the subject of increasing research activity. A review of the current knowledge of the role of sea ice in the climate system is therefore timely. We present a review that examines both the current state of understanding, as regards the impacts of sea-ice loss observed to date, and climate model projections, to highlight hypothesised future changes and impacts on storm tracks and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Within the broad climate-system perspective, the topics of storminess and large-scale variability will be specifically considered. We then consider larger-scale impacts on the climatic system by reviewing studies that have focused on the interaction between sea-ice extent and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Finally, an overview of the representation of these topics in the literature in the context of IPCC climate projections is presented. While most agree on the direction of Arctic sea-ice change, the rates amongst the various projections vary greatly. Similarly, the response of storm tracks and climate variability are uncertain, exacerbated possibly by the influence of other factors. A variety of scientific papers on the relationship between sea-ice changes and atmospheric variability have brought to light important aspects of this complex topic. Examples are an overall reduction in the number of Arctic winter storms, a northward shift of mid-latitude winter storms in the Pacific and a delayed negative NAO-like response in autumn/winter to a reduced Arctic sea-ice cover (at least in some months). This review paper discusses this research and the disagreements, bringing about a fresh perspective on this issue."

How and why species are distributed in the global oceans, and whether net ecosystem function can be accurately predicted from community composition are fundamental questions for marine scientists. Many of the most abundant clades of marine bacteria, including the <em>Prochlorococcus</em>, <em>Synechococcus</em>, SAR11, SAR86 and <em>Roseobacter</em>, have a very broad, if not a cosmopolitan distribution. However this is not reflected in an underlying genetic identity. Rather, widespread distribution in these organisms is achieved by the existence of closely related but discrete ecotypes that display niche adaptations. Closely related ecotypes display specific nutritional or energy generating mechanisms and are adapted to different physical parameters including temperature, salinity, and hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, biotic phenomena such as selective grazing and viral loss contribute to the success or failure of ecotypes allowing some to compete effectively in particular marine provinces but not in others. An additional layer of complexity is added by ocean currents and hydrodynamic specificity of water body masses that bound microbial dispersal and immigration. These vary in space and time with respect to intensity and direction, making the definition of large biogeographic provinces problematic. A deterministic theory aimed at understanding how all these factors shape microbial life in the oceans can only proceed through analysis of microbial traits, rather than pure phylogenetic assessments. Trait based approaches seek mechanistic explanations for the observed temporal and spatial patterns. This review will present successful recent advances in phylogenetic and trait based biogeographic analyses in some of the most abundant marine taxa."

For example, atmospheric transport models can be used when high resolution predicted concentrations in atmospheric compartments are required, while spatial multimedia fate models may be preferred for regulatory risk assessment, life cycle impact assessment of chemicals, or when the partitioning of chemical substances in a multimedia environment is considered. The goal of this paper is to review and compare different spatially resolved environmental models, according to their spatial, temporal and chemical domains, with a closer insight into spatial multimedia fate models, to achieve a better understanding of their strengths and limitations.

In 2013, Cotter and Holm introduced a new slice model, which they formulated using Hamilton’s variational principle, modified for this purpose. In this paper, we show the local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions of the related ISM (Incompressible Slice Model). The ISM is a modified version of the Cotter–Holm Slice Model (CHSM) that we have obtained by adapting the Lagrangian function in Hamilton’s principle for CHSM to the Euler–Boussinesq Eady incompressible case. Besides proving local existence and uniqueness, in this paper we also construct a blow-up criterion for the ISM, and study Arnold’s stability around a restricted class of equilibrium solutions. These results establish the potential applicability of the ISM equations in physically meaningful situations."

Although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context, they have shown significant increases in use and applications. Herein, we provide a systematic review of 328 articles on marine ENMs and SDMs published between 1990 and 2016, aiming to identify their main applications and the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed, including spatial scale, geographic realm, taxonomic groups assessed, algorithms implemented, and data sources. Of the 328 studies, 48 % were at local scales, with a hotspot of research effort in the North Atlantic Ocean. Most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms underlying geographic ranges (64 %). A few attempted to evaluate impacts of climate change (19 %) or to develop strategies for conservation (11 %). Several correlative techniques have been used, but most common was the machine-learning approach Maxent (46 %) and statistical approaches such as generalized additive models GAMs (22 %) and generalized linear models, GLMs (14 %). The groups most studied were fish (23 %), molluscs (16 %), and marine mammals (14 %), the first two with commercial importance and the last important for conservation. We noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of ENMs <em>versus</em> SDMs, and a rather consistent failure to differentiate between them. This review exposed a need to know, reduce, and report error and uncertainty associated with species’ occurrence records and environmental data. In addition, particular to marine realms, a third dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process, referring to the vertical position of the species, which will improve the precision and utility of these models. So too is of paramount importance the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems, especially in the case of highly mobile species."

The Gulf is a natural hydrocarbon basin, rich with stores of oil and gas that lie in reservoirs deep beneath the seafloor. The natural seepage of hydrocarbons across the Gulf system is extensive and, thus, the system׳s biological components experience ephemeral, if not, frequent, hydrocarbon exposure. In contrast to natural seepage, which is diffuse and variable over space and time, the 2010 Macondo oil well blowout, represented an intense, focused hydrocarbon infusion to the Gulf׳s deepwaters."

Recently, new experimental, numerical and theoretical works have revealed that many turbulent configurations deviate from the ideal three and two dimensional homogeneous and isotropic cases characterized by the presence of a strictly direct and inverse energy cascade, respectively. New phenomena appear that alter the global and local transfer properties. In this review, we provide a critical summary of historical and recent works from a unified point of view and we present a classification of all known transfer mechanisms. Beside the classical cases of direct and inverse energy cascades, the different scenarios include: split cascades for which an invariant flows both to small and large scales simultaneously, multiple/dual cascades of different quantities, bi-directional cascades where direct and inverse transfers of the same invariant coexist in the same scale-range and finally equilibrium states where no cascades are present, including the case when a large scale condensate is formed. We classify all possible transitions from one scenario to another as the control parameters are changed and we analyse when and why different configurations are observed. Our discussion is based on a set of paradigmatic applications: helical turbulence, rotating and/or stratified flows, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence, and passive/active scalars where the transfer properties are altered as one changes the embedding dimensions, the thickness of the domain or other relevant control parameters, as, e.g., the Reynolds, Rossby, Froude, Péclet, or Alfvén numbers. We briefly discuss the presence of anomalous scaling laws in 3D hydrodynamics and in other configurations, in connection with the intermittent nature of the energy dissipation in configuration space. A quick overview is also provided concerning the importance of cascades in other applications such as bounded flows, quantum fluids, relativistic and compressible turbulence, and active matter, together with a discussion of the implications for turbulent modelling. Finally, we present a series of open problems and challenges that future work needs to address."

The model consists of 9 biological components: nitrate, ammonium, &gt;5μm phytoplankton, &lt;5μm phytoplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates/dinoflagellates (5–20 μm), heterotrophic dinoflagellates (&gt;20 μm), ciliates, fast sinking detritus and slow sinking detritus. Calculations were made for the fluxes of carbon between biological components within the upper 45m of the water column. The temporal development of primary production during the simulation period of two weeks was in good agreement with field estimates, which varied between 248 and 436mgC.m<sup>−2</sup>.d<sup>−1</sup>. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates had the greatest impact on carbon flux, with a grazing rate of 168mgC.m<sup>−2</sup>.d<sup>−1</sup>. Herbivorous grazing by microzooplankton amounted to 215mgC.m<sup>−2</sup>.d<sup>−1</sup>, whereas grazing by copepods on phytoplankton was 35mgC.m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>. Copepods grazing on microzooplankton was minor (0.47mgC.m<sup>−2</sup>.d<sup>−1</sup>) and the export flux from the upper 45m was 302mgC.m<sup>−2</sup>.d<sup>−1</sup>. Sensitivity analyses, in which the grazing parameters (i.e the functional relationship between ingestion and food concentration) were changed, were carried out on the heterotrophic dinoflagellate, ciliate and heterotrophic nanoflagellates/dinoflagellate components of the model. These changes did not alter the temporal development of heterotrophic nanoflagellates/dinoflagellates biomass significantly, but ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates were more sensitive to variations in the grazing parameters. The overall conclusion from this modelling study is that the coupling between small phytoplankton and heterotrophic nanoflagellates was the quantitatively most important process controlling carbon flow in this region."

Vortex dynamics play an important role in the study of turbulent fluid motions. Soliton interactions are elastic––that is, their properties, such as the amplitude and phase speed, are conserved under interactions. However, vortex interactions are typically inelastic––that is, vortex properties are often not preserved during collisions with each other, for example, they can merge. The chapter describes the derivation of the Poisson equation for vortex dynamics in the plane and gives the specific cases of the Poisson equation for vortex dynamics in the plane. It explores the potential vorticity equation (PVE) that offers a vast, rich source of nonlinear phenomena to be studied in the context of large and meso-scale motions in the ocean and the atmosphere. The potential vorticity equation is easily linearized by removing the Jacobian term. A key idea in the implementation of the soliton methods is that the Sinh–Poisson equation has soliton solutions, but the vortex solution consists of bound solitons with phase locking––that is, two phase-locked solitons create a particular vortex solution."

For 80 years popular opinion has held that most of Madagascar's terrestrial vertebrate fauna arrived via transoceanic dispersal (i.e., by rafting or swimming), chiefly from Africa. The alternative solution of recurrent uplifts of a land bridge connected with cyclic global kinematic revolutions, proposed in 2021, was recently challenged. The 2021 paper demonstrates the strength of a comprehensive holistic approach (sedimentary, tectonic, kinematic, and palaeo-environmental studies) based on the new, large-scale dataset provided by the PAMELA (Passive Margins Exploration Laboratories) research project. This episodic land bridges hypothesis was tested with divergence estimates of dispersal mechanisms of Madagascar's Angiosperm taxa.

Landfill sites can emit significant quantities of greenhouse gases (GHGs; e.g., methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide) and release toxic and odorous compounds (e.g., sulfides). Due to the complex composition and characteristics of landfill surface gas emissions, the quantification and control of landfill emissions are challenging. This review attempts to comprehensively understand landfill emission quantification and control options by primarily focusing on GHGs and odor compounds. Landfill emission quantification was highlighted by combining different emissions monitoring approaches to improve the quality of landfill emission data. Also, landfill emission control requires a specific approach that targets emission compounds or a systematic approach that reduces overall emissions by combining different control methods since the diverse factors dominate the emissions of various compounds and their transformation. This integrated knowledge of emission quantification and control options for GHGs and odor compounds is beneficial for establishing field monitoring campaigns and incorporating mitigation strategies to quantify and control multiple landfill emissions."

This process leads to topside icing in sufficiently cold and windy conditions. This paper establishes the current state of the art understanding of the physical behaviour of wave impact and the process of spray cloud formation upstream of a ship or marine structure. Previous work on the behaviour of spray at the bow is extensively reviewed. The process of spray formation is related to several complicated phenomena including wave slamming, jet formation after impact, sheet and droplet breakup, and production of the spray cloud on the top surface of the ship bow. Progress has been made in modeling some of these phenomena, including numerical methods for modeling the free surface, the phenomena of slamming, air entrainment, and water breakup. Field observation methods for measuring characteristic parameters of the spray are also reviewed. Related phenomena, such as wave slamming on a wall and bow waves, are followed from the numerical and experimental point of view. Although direct numerical simulations of spray formation following by wave impacts are not yet a practical option, constituent models for each separate part of this problem (e.g., free surface modeling, slamming on walls, air entrainment, etc.) show promising progress. This work is a guide for researchers of off-deck phenomena in the field of marine icing. The puzzle pieces and the gaps are examined to help design a new research strategy in this field."

Numerous studies of the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the swash zone in recent years have pointed out the importance of swash processes in terms of science advancement and practical applications. Evidently, the hydrodynamics of the swash zone are complex and not fully understood. Key hydrodynamic processes include both high-frequency bores and low-frequency infragravity motions, and are affected by wave breaking and turbulence, shear stresses and bottom friction. The prediction of sediment transport that results from these complex and interacting processes is a challenging task. Besides, sediment transport in this oscillatory environment is affected by high-order processes such as the beach groundwater flow. Most relationships between sediment transport and flow characteristics are empirical, based on laboratory experiments and/or field measurements. Analytical solutions incorporating key factors such as sediment characteristics and concentration, waves and coastal aquifer interactions are unavailable. Therefore, numerical models for wave and sediment transport are widely used by coastal engineers. This review covers mechanisms of sediment transport, important forcing factors, governing equations of wave-induced flow, groundwater interactions, empirical and numerical relations of cross-shore and longshore sediment transport in the swash zone. Major advantages and shortcomings of various numerical models and approaches are highlighted and reviewed. These will provide coastal modelers an impetus for further detailed investigations of fluid and sediment transport in the swash zone."

While their associated geochemical and petrogenetic systems are well understood, the fluid dynamic processes that control the formations of ore bodies and textures are much less well known, particularly during lateral magma emplacement. Using a computational fluid dynamic modelling approach, we depict the transport and deposition of sulfides in two distinct laminar and turbulent horizontal flow settings that correspond to mafic intrusion-hosted and komatiite-hosted deposits, respectively. In horizontally flowing mafic magma, there is no vertical velocity component to offset the gravitational settling of sulfide liquid droplets, while the relatively high viscosity of mafic melt retards their deposition. Single droplets follow curved trajectories analogous to horizontal projectile motion and can be transported considerable distances before reaching the base of the flow, depending on their sizes and relative elevations in the flow, and the melt viscosity and flow velocity. Lateral motion of sulfide-rich mafic magma will eventually evolve into either stratified or plug flow with some pre-accumulation of sulfides in the lower parts of channels, which may be the precursors of economic ore bodies in mafic intrusions. While, volcanic or shallow subvolcanic komatiite systems are characterized by turbulent flows, in which the vertical velocity fluctuations can usually hold dense sulfide droplets in suspension, making long-distance transport of sulfides more feasible."

Due to their short generation times and tight coupling to lower trophic levels, populations of SPF display large boom-and-bust dynamics that are closely linked to climate variability. To reveal emerging global research trends on SPF as opposed to more recently published, ecosystem-specific reviews of SPF, we reviewed the literature published in two, 6-year periods in the new millennium (2001–2006, and 2011–2016) straddling the publication of a large, global review of the dynamics of SPF in 2009. We explored intrinsic and extrinsic (bottom-up) factors influencing the dynamics of SPF such as anchovies, sardines, herrings and sprats within the sub-order Clupeidae. Published research efforts within 16 different biogeographic ocean regions were compiled (more than 900 studies) and compared to identify i) new milestones and advances in our understanding, ii) emerging research trends and iii) remaining gaps in knowledge. Studies were separated into 5 categories (field, laboratory, mesocosms, long-term statistical analyses and spatially-explicit modelling) and discussed in relation to 10 bottom-up categories including 5 abiotic factors (temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, density), 3 physical processes (advection, turbulence, turbidity) and 2 biotic factors (prey quantity and quality). The peer-reviewed literature reflects changes in the number of studies between the two time periods including increases (Mediterranean Sea, Humboldt Current) and decreases (Australia, Benguela Current). Our review highlights i) gaps in ecological knowledge on young juveniles and, in general, on the impacts of hypoxia and heatwaves on SPF, ii) the utility of paleo studies in exploring population drivers, iii) the continued need to develop spatially-explicit, full life-cycle models, iv) the importance of exploring how density-dependent processes impact vital rates (growth, survival, reproduction), and v) the benefits of international collaboration for knowledge transfer and building unifying hypotheses on the role of bottom-up factors and processes that regulate SPF populations."

We suggest that this exchange is driven by the early-spring release of gravitational energy excess, which was maintained during winter by vertical mixing; when mixing ceases, the 500-km long vertically homogeneous layer with longitudinal salinity gradient relaxes to a more gravitationally stable stratification. This exchange forces winter-cold (1.5–4 °C in different years) surface waters of moderate salinity (7.5–8) to penetrate rather quickly into intermediate layers, where they are then effectively conserved throughout the warmer period as the core of the CIL. Such a temperature/salinity index is characteristic of waters of the upper mixed layer in the Bornholm Basin in March. The hypothesis is verified against published works on mean climatic data, intrusion activity in the Baltic Proper, numerical simulations of thermohaline conveyor and laboratory experiments."

Emphasis is on conceptual foundations and methodology, not practical applications. Particular attention is paid to equations and formalism appropriate to strongly magnetized, fully ionized plasmas. Extensive reference to the literature on neutral-fluid turbulence is made, but the unique properties and problems of plasmas are emphasized throughout. Discussions are given of quasilinear theory, weak-turbulence theory, resonance-broadening theory, and the clump algorithm. The direct-interaction approximation (DIA) is developed as a central focus of the article, and its relationship to the earlier plasma theories is explained. Various methods of renormalized perturbation theory are described, then unified with the aid of the generating-functional formalism of Martin, Siggia, and Rose. A general expression for the renormalized dielectric function is deduced and discussed in detail. Modern approaches such as decimation and PDF methods are described. Derivations of DIA-based Markovian closures are discussed. The eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure is shown to be nonrealizable in the presence of waves, and a new realizable Markovian closure is presented. The test-field model and a realizable modification thereof are also summarized. Numerical solutions of various closures for some plasma-physics paradigms are reviewed. The variational approach to bounds on transport is developed. Miscellaneous topics include Onsager symmetries for turbulence, the interpretation of entropy balances for both kinetic and fluid descriptions, self-organized criticality, statistical interactions between disparate scales, and the roles of both mean and random shear. Appendices are provided on Fourier transform conventions, dimensional and scaling analysis, the derivations of nonlinear gyrokinetic and gyrofluid equations, stochasticity criteria for quasilinear theory, formal aspects of resonance-broadening theory, Novikov's theorem, the treatment of weak inhomogeneity, the derivation of the Vlasov and gyrokinetic weak-turbulence wave kinetic equation from a fully renormalized description, some features of a code for solving the DIA and related Markovian closures, the details of the solution of the EDQNM closure for a solvable three-wave model, and the notation used in the article."

Thus far, the nature, the methods, and a number of crucial issues concerning the use of dynamic downscaling are still not well understood. The most important issue is whether, and if so, under what conditions dynamic downscaling is really capable of adding more information at different scales compared to the GCM or reanalysis that imposes lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) to the RCMs. There are controversies regarding the downscaling ability. In this review paper we present several factors that have consistently demonstrated strong impact on dynamic downscaling ability in intraseasonal and seasonal simulations/predictions and future projection. Those factors include setting of the RCM experiment (e.g. imposed LBC quality, domain size and position, LBC coupling, and horizontal resolution); as well as physical processes, mainly convective schemes and vegetation and soil processes that include initializations, vegetation specifications, and planetary boundary layer and surface coupling. These studies indicate that RCMs have downscaling ability in some aspects but only under certain conditions. Any significant weaknesses in one of these aspects would cause an RCM to lose its dynamic downscaling ability. This paper also briefly presents challenges faced in current RCM dynamic downscaling and future prospective, which cover the application of coupled ocean–atmosphere RCMs, ensemble applications, and future projections."

A total of 76 publications and other sources of grey literature were assessed, and these highlighted that over 5400 individuals from 40 different species were recorded as entangled in, or associated with, ghost gear. Interestingly, there appeared to be a deficit of research in the Indian, Southern, and Arctic Oceans; and so, we recommend that future studies focus efforts on these areas. Furthermore, studies assessing the effects of ghost gear on elasmobranchs, manatees, and dugongs should also be prioritised, as these groups were underrepresented in the current literature. The development of regional databases, capable of recording entanglement incidences following a minimum global set of criteria, would be a logical next step in order to analyse the effect that ghost gear has on megafauna populations worldwide."

The latter presents an intermediate approach between expensive wave-resolving two-phase flow models and highly parametrized wave-averaged models. Innovative features include the use of weakly compressible assumptions in the hydrodynamics and morphological acceleration of bed changes to speed up numerical simulations. The model accurately simulates the successive offshore and onshore bar migration observed in a large-scale flume experiment in response to wave forcing representing storm and post-storm (recovery) conditions. The diagnosis of sand transport and the analysis of an ensemble-averaged asymmetric wave cycle reveal the migration mechanisms in each phase. In all cases, sediment resuspension is impacted by breaker-induced turbulence, while sediment transport and bed evolution are primarily the result of the undertow distribution – the breaker-induced seaward undercurrent – across the sandbar. There is also a significant contribution from asymmetric wave-related onshore fluxes, due to greater mobilization and currents during the wave crest period."

The main purpose is to understand which dynamical processes are filtered out by the RSW model while they occur sometimes in real experiment. Even if the RSW equations are based on drastic assumptions (hydrostatic balance, quasibidimensionality, and weak dissipation), it is a surprisingly good model of many phenomena in the atmosphere and the ocean. The rapidity of the geostrophic adjustment does not depend on the size or the amplitude of the initial unbalance state. Therefore, the existence of a mean adjusted state does not depend on the presence of fast wave motion. However, the inertia–gravity waves detected in the experiment have a dispersive behavior because of the finite value of the aspect ratio parameter α."

The vane shape is generally aerodynamic for directing the flow to runner vanes with the effective transformation of pressure energy to kinetic energy. Suspended particles result in erosion of the spanwise surfaces, and leading and trailing edge side of the guide vane. The eroded portions showed the formation of secondary flow and horseshoe vortex along with increased leakage flow on guide vane surfaces. Flow turbulence generated through the guide vanes increases the flow instability in the main flow and reduces the hydraulic and mechanical efficiency of the turbine. This review focuses on the impact of sediment particles on erosive wear of guide vanes of Francis turbine. The investigated flow field around different guide vane profiles have also been summarized along with an estimation of erosion through field study, laboratory test setup, and numerical study. The review also focuses on the post erosion problems, vulnerable locations, research gaps, and the possible solutions, for mitigating the erosion of the guide vanes."

Several scales are significant for interactions between predator and prey over the life cycle of each organism. A key factor is the encounter probability (group and individual). On the basis of physical considerations, the group encounter probability depends upon the respective patch sizes (on the order of 10s of km) and their relative dispersion (or aggregation) rates in turbulent systems. The encounter probability at the individual level is affected by the relative motion of the predator and the prey and is controlled by the velocity spectrum. In addition, at the individual level, the striking distance of a predator will depend on motility and perception of the prey. Here we address the mechanics of copepod predation on phytoplankton and the coupling with the physics of turbulent fluid motions. Our aim is to review pertinent fluid dynamics, on scales of less than a few metres, to provide a framework in which to consider the role of fluctuating fluid velocities on copepod feeding."

Replacing the tower and foundation of conventional wind turbines can substantially reduce the material use and, consequently, the cost of energy, while providing access to wind at higher altitudes. Because the flight operation of tethered devices can be adjusted to a varying wind resource, the energy availability increases in comparison to conventional wind turbines. Ultimately, this represents a rich topic for the study of real-time optimal control strategies that must function robustly in a spatiotemporally varying environment. With all of the opportunities that airborne wind energy systems bring, however, there are also a host of challenges, particularly those relating to robustness in extreme operating conditions and launching/landing the system (especially in the absence of wind). Thus, airborne wind energy systems can be viewed as a control system designer’s paradise or nightmare, depending on one’s perspective. This survey article explores insights from the development and experimental deployment of control systems for airborne wind energy platforms over approximately the past two decades, highlighting both the optimal control approaches that have been used to extract the maximal amount of power from tethered systems and the robust modal control approaches that have been used to achieve reliable launch, landing, and extreme wind operation. This survey will detail several of the many prototypes that have been deployed over the last decade and will discuss future directions of airborne wind energy technology as well as its nascent adoption in other domains, such as ocean energy."

The main reason for this is the large northward transport of heat that extends to high latitudes and crosses the Greenland–Scotland Ridge to enter the Nordic Seas and the Arctic. There the warm Atlantic water is converted to colder water masses that return southwards over the ridge partly as surface outflows and partly as overflows through the deep passages across the ridge. In this paper, the state of knowledge on the exchanges especially across the eastern part of the Greenland–Scotland Ridge is reviewed based on results from the ICES NANSEN (North Atlantic–Norwegian Sea Exchanges) project, from the Nordic WOCE project and from other sources. The accumulated evidence allows us to describe the exchanges in fair detail; the origins of the waters, the patterns of their flow towards and over the ridge and their ultimate fate. There is also increasing information on temporal variations of the exchanges although dynamical changes are still not well understood. Quantitative estimates for the volume transport of most of the overflow branches seem reasonably well established, and transport measurements of the Atlantic inflows to the Nordic Seas are approaching acceptable levels of confidence which allows preliminary budgets to be presented. The deep overflows are driven by pressure gradients set up by the formation of deep and intermediate water. The dominance of deep overflows over surface outflows in the water budget argues that this thermohaline forcing also dominates over direct wind stress and estuarine forcing in driving the Atlantic water inflow across the Greenland–Scotland Ridge, while wind stress seems to influence the characteristics and distribution of the Atlantic water north of the ridge."

A cold, dense pool flanked by strong nearbed density gradients was present from May until October. In spring, salinity had a dominant influence on the density structure but from June until October temperature controlled the density stratification. The trajectories of 55 satellite-tracked Argos drifters demonstrated the existence of the cyclonic circulation pattern that constitutes the western Irish Sea gyre and defined the gyre's spatial extent. Several distinct recirculation paths were observed and the implications for planktonic organisms of the seasonal variability in the recirculation are discussed. Drifter speeds were in good agreement with geostrophic calculations based on the observed density field and with de-tided acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements. The dynamical significance of strong nearbed gradients (bottom fronts) is highlighted. The location of the dynamically significant baroclinicity below the level of wind mixing explains the persistence of the cold pool and cyclonic circulation until late October. The dataset described here is valuable for environmental management purposes and it facilitates testing of the prognostic capabilities of the present generation of density-advecting numerical models."

They frequently result in turbulent mixing, which has a major impact on the overall flow development and other effective material properties. This can either be a desired outcome, an unwelcome side effect, or just an unavoidable consequence, but must in all cases be characterized in any model. The RT instability occurs at an interface between different fluids, when the light fluid is accelerated into the heavy. The RM instability may be considered a special case of the RT instability, when the acceleration provided is impulsive in nature such as that resulting from a shock wave. In this pedagogical review, we provide an extensive survey of the applications and examples where such instabilities play a central role. First, fundamental aspects of the instabilities are reviewed including the underlying flow physics at different stages of development, followed by an overview of analytical models describing the linear, nonlinear and fully turbulent stages. RT and RM instabilities pose special challenges to numerical modeling, due to the requirement that the sharp interface separating the fluids be captured with fidelity. These challenges are discussed at length here, followed by a summary of the significant progress in recent years in addressing them. Examples of the pivotal roles played by the instabilities in applications are given in the context of solar prominences, ionospheric flows in space, supernovae, inertial fusion and pulsed-power experiments, pulsed detonation engines and Scramjets. Progress in our understanding of special cases of RT/RM instabilities is reviewed, including the effects of material strength, chemical reactions, magnetic fields, as well as the roles the instabilities play in ejecta formation and transport, and explosively expanding flows. The article is addressed to a broad audience, but with particular attention to graduate students and researchers who are interested in the state-of-the-art in our understanding of the instabilities and the unique issues they present in the applications in which they are prominent."

The review includes a history of sea fog research, field programs, forecasting methods, and detection of sea fog via satellite observations where similarity in radiative properties of fog top and the underlying sea induce further complexity. The main thrust of the study is to provide insight into causality of fog including its initiation, maintenance, and destruction. The interplay between the various physical processes behind the several stages of marine fog is among the most challenging aspects of the problem. An effort is made to identify this interplay between processes that include the microphysics of fog formation and maintenance, the influence of large-scale circulations and precipitation/clouds, radiation, turbulence (air–sea interaction), and advection.

Understanding and predicting these changes are very important for an scientific-based, sustained management of these systems. Morphodynamic process-based numerical models can be used for this purpose. The development and validation of a new three-dimensional unstructured grid morphodynamic modelling system, MORSELFE, aiming at simulating short-term morphological evolutions of estuaries and sandy rivers (temporal scale of days to month), are presented. MORSELFE couples a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, with an advection–diffusion transport model for the suspended sediments, an empirical formula for the bed load, and a bed updating module. The model considers the simulation of non-cohesive sediment and does not account for wave effects. A new approach is proposed to compute the erosive fluxes, which adapts them to the vertical grid resolution. The use of unstructured grids and the implementation in parallel mode make MORSELFE particularly adapted to engineering applications. The model was assessed and validated against analytical and experimental test cases, also allowing the inference on the optimum choice of the model parameters and variables."

The uncertainty in ATM can be reduced, but it cannot be eliminated at all for many reasons: the impossibility of error-free measurements, the discretization of the continuous atmospheric flow in measuring and modeling, there is no analytical solution of Navier-Stokes equations which governs the atmospheric motion, the stochastic nature of the radioactive processes, and the ill-posedness of the inverse modeling. Therefore, our knowledge about the atmospheric state is incomplete and inexact. Thus, any representation of the atmospheric state is just an approximation of the unknown true state of the atmosphere, even if all available observations, the best data assimilation scheme, and the best coupled Earth-System models are used. Therefore, the quantification of the uncertainty should be an essential part of the operational ATM in CTBT's RN monitoring and verification procedures. The current work reviews the different sources of uncertainty included in these procedures, and it discusses the available methods to quantify these uncertainties regarding the current state-of-the-art and future development in the atmospheric modeling and data assimilation."

However, economic viability has not been achieved yet, for which maximisation of power production over the full range of sea conditions is crucial. Precise mathematical models are essential to accurately reproduce the behaviour, including nonlinear dynamics, and understand the performance of wave energy converters. Therefore, nonlinear models must be considered, which are required for power absorption assessment, simulation of devices motion and model-based control systems. Main sources of nonlinear dynamics within the entire chain of a wave energy converter - incoming wave trains, wave-structure interaction, power take-off systems or mooring lines- are identified, with especial attention to the wave-device hydrodynamic interaction, and their influence is studied in the present paper for different types of converters. In addition, different approaches to model nonlinear wave-device interaction are presented, highlighting their advantages and drawbacks. Besides the traditional Navier-Stokes equations or potential flow methods, ‘new’ methods such as system-identification models, smoothed particle hydrodynamics or nonlinear potential flow methods are analysed."

These discrete elements, or ‘particles’, can be droplets, bubbles or solid particles having different sizes. This situation encompasses a wide range of phenomena, from nano-particles and colloids sensitive to the molecular fluctuations of the carrier fluid to inertia particles transported by the large-scale motions of turbulent flows and, depending on the phenomenon studied, a broad spectrum of approaches have been developed.</p><p id=""d1e1831"">The aim of the present article is to analyze statistical models of particles in turbulent flows by addressing this issue as the extension of the classical formulations operating at a molecular or meso-molecular level of description. It has a three-fold purpose: (1) to bring out the thread of continuity between models for discrete particles in turbulent flows (above the hydrodynamical level of description) and classical mesoscopic formulations of statistical physics (below the hydrodynamical level); (2) to reveal the specific challenges met by statistical models in turbulence; (3) to establish a methodology for modeling particle dynamics in random media with non-zero space and time correlations. The presentation is therefore centered on organizing the different approaches, establishing links and clarifying physical foundations.</p><p id=""d1e1833"">The analysis of disperse two-phase flow models is developed by discussing: first, approaches of classical statistical physics; then, by considering models for single-phase turbulent flows; and, finally, by addressing current formulations for discrete particles in turbulent flows. This brings out that particle-based models do not cease to exist above the hydrodynamical level and offer great interest when combined with proper stochastic formulations to account for the lack of equilibrium distributions and scale separation. In the course of this study, general results for dynamical systems influenced by colored or white noises are established which point to the necessity of developing statistical models for particles in random media from a new standpoint that breaks away from descriptions based only on particle kinetic variables. This is needed to obtain well-posed formulations of particle dispersion by non fully-resolved turbulent flows and suggests also to revisit classical ideas of particle–particle interactions in the presence of a turbulent flow which correlates the dynamics of colliding discrete elements."

I","Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) and Richtmyer–Meshkov (RM) instabilities play an important role in a wide range of engineering, geophysical, and astrophysical flows. They represent a triggering event that, in many cases, leads to large-scale turbulent mixing. Much effort has been expended over the past 140 years, beginning with the seminal work of Lord Rayleigh, to predict the evolution of the instabilities and of the instability-induced mixing layers. The objective of Part I of this review is to provide the basic properties of the flow, turbulence, and mixing induced by RT, RM, and Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. Historical efforts to study these instabilities are briefly reviewed, and the significance of these instabilities is discussed for a variety of flows, particularly for astrophysical flows and for the case of inertial confinement fusion. Early experimental efforts are described, and analytical attempts to model the linear, and nonlinear regimes of these mixing layers are examined. These analytical efforts include models for both single-mode and multi-mode initial conditions, as well as multi-scale models to describe the evolution. Comparisons of these models and theories to experimental and simulation studies are then presented. Next, attention is paid to the issue of the influence of stabilizing mechanisms (e.g., viscosity, surface tension, and diffuse interface) on the evolution of these instabilities, as well as the limitations and successes of numerical methods. Efforts to study these instabilities and mixing layers using group-theoretic ideas, as well as more formal notions of turbulence cascade processes during the later stages of the induced mixing layers, are inspected. A key element of the review is the discussion of the late-time self-similar scaling for the RT and RM growth factors, <span class=""math""><math><mi is=""true"" mathvariant=""normal"">α</mi></math></span> and <span class=""math""><math><mi is=""true"" mathvariant=""normal"">θ</mi></math></span>. These parameters are influenced by the initial conditions and much of the observed variation can be explained by this. In some cases, these instabilities induced flows can transition to turbulence. Both the spatial and temporal criteria to achieve the transition to turbulence have been examined."

The circulation patterns suggested before the 1990s can be categorized into two groups, depending on the identified origin of the Tsushima Warm Current in the Korea-Tsushima Straits: (i) branching from the Kuroshio southwest of Kyushu, or (ii) northeastward continuation of the Taiwan Strait throughflow. The branching of the Kuroshio southwest of Kyushu and northeast of Taiwan was clearly evidenced by current measurements and concurrent hydrographic surveys. However, there is still no clear evidence for the northeastward pathway of Taiwan Strait throughflow across the mid-shelf area of the East China Sea. Target-oriented surveys in the 1990s and 2000s employing advanced instruments, such as drifter tracking and acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements, now provide decisive proof of the clockwise rounding of the Cheju Warm Current around Jeju-do throughout the year, of the northeastward extension of Changjiang discharge in summer, and of the presence of the Yellow Sea Warm Current only in winter. Thus, both coastal currents in shallow water and secondary branch currents of the Kuroshio (such as the Yellow Sea Warm Current) are found to significantly change from winter to summer. To better present the basic pattern of YECS circulation and its seasonality, we have constructed seasonal circulations patterns, based on review results, on the newly-compiled drifter trajectories, and on hydrographic observations. Further investigations should be carried out in future, with support of comprehensive current measurements on shelf areas and through elaborate numerical modeling."

MOSM is a complex system affected by various factors, such as characteristics of spilled oil and environmental conditions. Oil spill detection, characterization, and monitoring; risk evaluation; response selection and process optimization; and waste management are the key components of MOSM demanding timely decision-making. Applying robust computational techniques based on real-time data (e.g., satellite and aerial observations) and historical records of oil spill incidents may considerably facilitate decision-making processes. Various soft-computing and artificial intelligence-based models and mathematical techniques have been used for the implementation of MOSM’s components. This study presents a review of literature published since 2010 on the application of computational techniques in MOSM. A statistical evaluation is performed concerning the temporal distribution of papers, publishers’ engagement, research subfields, countries of studies, and selected case studies. Key findings reported in the literature are summarized for two main practices in MOSM: spill detection, characterization, and monitoring; and spill management and response optimization.

Outdoor air quality affects the indoor environment. Highway traffic-generated ultrafine particles (UFPs) carry toxic substances, posing a serious threat to pedestrians and residents. Existing literature has shown that the primary sources of UFPs are vehicle emissions, combustion sources, and atmospheric transformation. Particle number concentration and size distribution are mainly influenced by the type of vehicle, traffic volume, wind speed and direction, atmospheric dilution and coagulation or distance from the road. The toxicological relationship between UFPs and human health needs to be further investigated. Prediction models of UFPs transport include line source dispersion, street canyon, and Gaussian models. Line source diffusion models can be used in open streets and highways. Street canyon models are mainly used in metropolitan areas. Gaussian models can be used on flat roads. The results of these three models have randomness and uncertainty and are suitable for short-term models. Numerical models can handle diffusion problems of complex street patterns. Commonly used non-numerical models include the STREET, CPBM, and OSPM models. The CPBM model had higher accuracy and practical value than the STREET model. The OSPM model considered the effect of street geometry and weather conditions in the calculation of pollution diffusion.

A large amount of literature on experimental feeding reports the existence of a zooplankton functional response in microcosms and small mesocosms, which goes a long way towards explaining the popularity of this framework both in mean-field (e.g. NPZD models) and spatially resolved models. On the other hand, the complex foraging behaviour of zooplankton (feeding cycles) as well as spatial heterogeneity of food and grazer distributions (plankton patchiness) across time and space scales raise questions as to the existence of a functional response of herbivores <em>in vivo</em>. In the current review, we discuss limitations of the ‘classical’ zooplankton functional response and consider possible ways to amend this framework to cope with the complexity of real planktonic ecosystems. Our general conclusion is that although the functional response of herbivores often does not exist in real ecosystems (especially in the form observed in the laboratory), this framework can be rather useful in modelling – but it does need some amendment which can be made based on various techniques of model reduction. We also show that the shape of the functional response depends on the spatial resolution (‘frame’) of the model. We argue that incorporating foraging behaviour and spatial heterogeneity in plankton models would not necessarily require the use of individual based modelling – an approach which is now becoming dominant in the literature. Finally, we list concrete future directions and challenges and emphasize the importance of a closer collaboration between plankton biologists and modellers in order to make further progress towards better descriptions of zooplankton grazing."

Also, although an inconsistency was observed among published articles about the role of microorganisms’ presence in heat transfer intensification of nanofluid flow inside the porous medium, the overwhelming majority of studies proved the contributing role of microorganisms on heat transfer enhancement.

In this review, we propose a new and complementary hypothesis describing the biophysical processes intervening in the recruitment of temperate fish larvae into estuaries. This new hypothesis, the Sense Acuity And Behavioral (SAAB) hypothesis, recognizes that recruitment is unlikely if the larvae drift passively with the water currents, and that successful recruitment requires the sense acuity of temperate fish larvae and their behavioral response to the estuarine cues present in coastal areas. We propose that temperate fish larvae use a hierarchy of sensory cues (odor, sound, visual and geomagnetic cues) to detect estuarine nursery areas and to aid during navigation towards these areas. The sensorial acuity increases along ontogeny, which coincides with increased swimming capabilities. The swimming strategies of post-flexion larvae differ from offshore areas to the tidal zone. In offshore areas, innate behavior might lead larvae towards the coast guided by a sun compass or by the earth's geomagnetic field. In areas under limited influence of estuarine plumes (either in energetic nearshore areas or offshore), post-flexion larvae display a searching swimming behavior for estuarine disconnected patches (infotaxis strategy). After finding an estuarine plume, larvae may swim along the increasing cue concentration to ingress into the estuary. Here, larvae exhibit a rheotaxis behavior and avoid displacement by longshore currents by keeping bearing during navigation. When larvae reach the vicinity of an estuary, merging diel rhythms with feeding and predator avoidance strategies with tidally induced movements is essential to increase their chances of estuarine ingress. A fish larva recruitment model developed for the Ria Formosa lagoon supports the general framework of the SAAB hypothesis. In this model, the ingress of virtual Sparidae temperate larvae into this nursery area increases from 1.5% to 32.1% when directional swimming guided by estuarine cues is included as a forcing parameter."

Model error in the subgrid scale is commonly seen in various applications as a natural consequence of stochastic parameterization, coarse-graining model reduction and many other approximations. The goal of this paper is to analyze and understand the impact of such a model error in affecting the nudging data assimilation (DA). To capture realistic features of turbulence, the Navier–Stokes equation (NSE) is utilized as the perfect model that provides the reference solution and creates the observations while a regularized NSE is adopted as the forecast model in DA. We extend the Larios–Pei method and establish our analytical and numerical results taking the simplified Bardina sub-grid scale model as a regularization for the NSE. The proof of the well-posedness and the convergence of the solutions of the DA to the truth, up to a bounded error that depends on a power of the regularization parameter, is shown. On the other hand, the numerical study of the proposed algorithm exploits the computationally more efficient 3D Sabra shell model and its ‘regularized’ counterpart, the characteristics of which mimic the energy cascade of the 3D NSE. While the proposed algorithm has a comparable performance as the Larios–Pei one in the high Reynolds number regime in successfully reproducing the energy spectrum and recovering the path-wise solutions up to the model error in the small scales, the proposed algorithm demonstrates certain improved behavior when the Reynolds number is moderate."

Solar air heater is one of the basic equipment through which solar energy is converted into thermal energy. CFD is a simulation tool which uses powerful computer and applied mathematics, to model fluid flow situations for the prediction of heat, mass and momentum transfer and optimal design in various heat transfer and fluid flow processes. The quality of the solutions obtained from CFD simulations are largely within the acceptable range proving that CFD is an effective tool for predicting the behavior and performance of a solar air heater. One of the great challenges in the design of a solar air heater using CFD approach is the selection of appropriate turbulence model. The decision about a suitable turbulence model chosen in a CFD computation is not easy. In this article a CFD investigation is also carried out to select best turbulence model for the design of a solar air heater. A modern CFD code ANSYS FLUENT v12.1 is used to simulate fluid flow through a conventional solar air heater. A two-dimensional flow is assumed.

The homogenization theory for periodic velocity fields and random velocity fields with short-range correlations is presented and utilized to examine subtle ways in which the flow geometry can influence the large-scale effective scalar diffusivity. Various forms of anomalous diffusion are then illustrated in some exactly solvable random velocity field models with long-range correlations similar to those present in fully developed turbulence. Here both random shear layer models with special geometry but general correlation structure as well as isotropic rapidly decorrelating models are emphasized. Some of the issues studied in detail in these models are superdiffusive and subdiffusive transport, pair dispersion, fractal dimensions of scalar interfaces, spectral scaling regimes, small-scale and large-scale scalar intermittency, and qualitative behavior over finite time intervals. Finally, it is demonstrated how exactly solvable models can be applied to test and design numerical simulation strategies and theoretical closure approximations for turbulent diffusion."

Along this pathway the upper water column is progressively cooled and freshened by winter convection, the subpolar mode water transformation process, and this sets the Inflow characteristics."

Nevertheless, there still remain many unknowns concerning the health and environmental impacts of these radionuclides. The present paper reviews the current understanding of the FDNPP accident with respect to interactions of the released radionuclides with the environment and impacts on human and non-human biota. Here, we scrutinize existing literature and combine and interpret observations and modeling assessments derived after Fukushima. Finally, we discuss the behavior and applications of radionuclides that might be used as tracers of environmental processes. This review focuses on <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>131</sup>I releases derived from Fukushima. Published estimates suggest total release amounts of 12–36.7<!-- --> <!-- -->PBq of <sup>137</sup>Cs and 150–160<!-- --> <!-- -->PBq of <sup>131</sup>I. Maximum estimated human mortality due to the Fukushima nuclear accident is 10,000 (due to all causes) and the maximum estimates for lifetime cancer mortality and morbidity are 1500 and 1800, respectively. Studies of plants and animals in the forests of Fukushima have recorded a range of physiological, developmental, morphological, and behavioral consequences of exposure to radioactivity. Some of the effects observed in the exposed populations include the following: hematological aberrations in Fukushima monkeys; genetic, developmental and morphological aberrations in a butterfly; declines in abundances of birds, butterflies and cicadas; aberrant growth forms in trees; and morphological abnormalities in aphids. These findings are discussed from the perspective of conservation biology."

This review paper proposes a new synthesis based on a) advances in the last 25<!-- --> <!-- -->years in nonlinear dynamics, b) a critical re-analysis of empirical aircraft and vertical sonde data, c) the systematic scale by scale, space–time exploitation of high resolution remotely sensed data and d) the systematic re-analysis of the outputs of numerical models of the atmosphere including reanalyses, e) a new turbulent model for the emergence of the climate from “weather” and climate variability. We conclude that Richardson's old idea of scale by scale simplicity — today embodied in multiplicative cascades — can accurately explain the statistical properties of the atmosphere and its models over most of the meteorologically significant range of scales, as well as at least some of the climate range. The resulting space–time cascade model combines these nonlinear developments with modern statistical analyses, it is based on strongly anisotropic and intermittent generalizations of the classical turbulence laws of Kolmogorov, Corrsin, Obukhov, and Bolgiano."

Part I: Review of present knowledge,"This paper reviews the present knowledge of aerosol dry deposition, with respect to modelling and experimental aspects. In the first part, special attention is given to the existing mechanistic models, either with an analytical or a differential structure. Their predictions are compared against available measurements for grass and forest environments, obtained under controlled aerosol size and aerodynamic conditions. The observed differences are largely related to the parameterisation of the aerosol collection within the canopy. In the second part, existing experimental results are reviewed and a synthesis is provided through different inter-comparisons concerning: (1) the influence of atmospheric stability on fine particle deposition, (2) the evolution of coarse aerosol deposition with aerodynamic conditions and (3) the aerosol size dependence of deposition on grass and forest canopies. A wider compilation of measurements obtained on different canopies is finally proposed."

In this paper, we use New Zealand as a case study to comprehensively assess, compare and quantify the net climate change impact of shifting land use between temperate forest and grassland. Forests store large amounts of carbon in their biomass, whereas grasslands contain relatively little biomass carbon. These biomass changes tend to dominate the carbon balance under land-use change. Soil carbon stocks usually do not change much after deforestation unless subsequent erosion occurs, but some soil carbon is often lost when grasslands are reforested with exotic plantations. Forest soils usually release little nitrous oxide or methane and can even oxidise small amounts of methane. Grasslands, on the other hand, can release a large amount of nitrous oxide, which may be further increased with fertilisation, and is higher for cattle- than sheep-grazed systems. Grazing animals increase emissions because the concentrated forms of nitrogen in their excreta allow it to escape from the system. Ruminant animals can also emit large amounts of methane. Land cover change in addition has direct radiative effects through the amount of solar radiation that is either absorbed by vegetated surfaces or reflected back into space. As forests typically absorb more radiation than grasslands, this slightly negates the greenhouse consequences of changes in carbon storage, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions under land-use change."

The 1997–98 El Niño event was defined by higher than normal sea levels at Monterey, which began in June 1997, peaked in November 1997, and returned to normal in March 1998. The warming took place in two distinct periods. During June and July 1997, the sea level increased as a result of stronger than normal coastal warming below 200 dbars and within 100 km of the coast, which was associated with poleward flow of saltier waters. During this period, deeper (400–1000 dbar) waters between 150–200 km from shore were also warmed and became more saline. Subsequently, sea level continued to rise through January 1998, mostly as a result of the warming above 200 dbars although, after a brief period of cooling in September 1997, waters below 200 dbar were also warmer than normal during this period. This winter warm anomaly was also coastally trapped, extending 200 km from shore and was accompanied by cooler and fresher water in the offshore California current. In March and April 1998, sea level dropped quickly to normal levels and inshore waters were fresher and warmer than the previous spring and flowed southward."

First, various methods for parameterizing these fluxes are developed from coupled continuity equations; also, the need for parameterizing various meteorological phenomena is illustrated. Next, different theoretical analyses of precipitation scavenging are outlined and data for collection efficiencies and washout ratios summarized. A resistance model for dry deposition illustrates that the rate-limiting stage of dry removal can occur in different layers depending on atmospheric and oceanic conditions and on properties of the pollutants; recent results for the dry fluxes of both particles and gases are summarized. After this review of known aspects of wet and dry removal processes, an interluding section uses the reviewed material to illustrate, with a number of worked examples, present capabilities to predict air pollution fluxes past the air-sea interface. Atmospheric residence times are also estimated. The second half of the paper emphasizes future research required to improve predictions of atmospheric removal processes and residence times."

Precise representation of the climatic parameters within an urban context is crucial for obtaining realistic results from building energy simulation studies. To this end, many research groups aim to include the best representative urban microclimate parameters as input to building energy simulations. Recently, coupling strategies have been adopted to facilitate a rapid and accurate exchange of information between urban microclimate and building energy models to output more realistic building energy simulation results that cannot be obtained in solo simulations. Despite the presence of many review articles on urban microclimate modeling and building energy simulation, a review of coupling strategies between these two has not been studied in recent literature. In this context, the present article goes beyond available studies with an up-to-date review of the coupling strategies between urban microclimate and building energy models. Available tools for urban microclimate simulation and building energy simulation are presented. The coupling strategies between these two different simulation tools are elucidated. Opportunities and limitations of coupling strategies are provided. Further, the achievements of recent research on adopting these coupling strategies are summarized, compiled, and discussed. Briefly, this article presents the urban microclimate and building energy simulation tools widely used in the literature with a particular emphasis on the research progress of coupling strategies between the two tools."

As advanced bioeconomy components, biorenewables derived from terrestrial, aquatic biomass and waste resources are expected to play significant roles over the next decades. This study provides an overview of potential biomass resources ranging from higher plant species to phototrophic microbial cluster, and their fundamental photosynthesis processes as well as biogeochemical carbon cycles involved in ecosystems. The review reflects empirical advances in conversion technologies and processes to manufacture value-added biorenewables from biomass and waste resources. The nexus perspective of resource-biorenewable-waste has been analysed to understand their interdependency and wider interaction with environmental resources and ecosystems. We further discussed the systems perspectives of biorenewables to develop fundamental understanding of resource flows and carbon cycles across biorenewable subsystems and highlight their spatial and temporal variability. Our in-depth review suggested the system challenges of biorenewable, which are subject to nonlinearity, variability and complexity. To unlock such system complexity and address the challenges, a whole systems approach is necessary to develop fundamental understanding, design novel biorenewable solutions. Our review reflects recent advances and prospects of computational methods for biorenewable systems modelling. This covers the development and applications of first principle models, process design, quantitative evaluation of sustainability and ecosystem services and mathematical optimisation to improve design, operation and planning of processes and develop emerging biorenewable systems. Coupling these advanced computational methods, a whole systems approach enables a multi-scale modelling framework to inherently link the processes and subsystems involved in biomass ecosystems and biorenewable manufacturing. Reviewing modelling advances, our study provides insights into the emerging opportunities in biorenewable research and highlights the frontier research directions, which have the potential to impact biorenewable sector sustainability."

Fluid mixing and chemical reactions,"In the accompanying paper, Part I, hydrothermal mineralising systems are considered as open chemical reactors that operate far from equilibrium to develop an exothermal alteration system with veining and brecciation, followed by competition between endothermic mineralisation and exothermic mineral reactions. In this sequel paper, we examine the interplay of these processes with fluid transport and the impact upon mineral deposition. Chemical reaction and flow in porous media admit two distinct mechanisms which result in significantly accelerated mixing. First, gradients in physical parameters such as chemical potential, fluid density and surface tension generate flow instabilities which form fluid/chemical <em>mixing machines</em> that propagate with the reaction front. Second, so-called <em>chaotic advection</em>, a behaviour in which fluid particles follow chaotic trajectories, arises inherently from Stokes flow in open porous networks as a result of the complexity of the pore geometry. For pore length-scales greater than ~<!-- --> <!-- -->1<!-- --> <!-- -->mm, these mechanisms significantly enhance mixing and hence metal/sulphide deposition. Furthermore, chaotic advection can also alter qualitative characteristics such as stability or speciation of non-equilibrium chemical reactions, with significant implications for enhanced mineralisation rates. Such interactions between chemical reaction and fluid advection generate mineral deposits with multifractal spatial signatures similar to those observed in the field. Such multifractal signatures render the spatial distributions <em>non-ergodic</em>, a fact which <em>process based geostatistics</em> must take into account."

River ice research has largely been driven by engineering and environmental problems that concern society, including ice effects on flooding, hydropower, navigation, ecology, and the environment. Important findings on river ice research before 1980 have been summarized by Ashton (1986) and Donchenko (1987). Significant progress has been made in river ice research in the last three decades. Mathematical modeling has been an essential part of this progress. Mathematical models have been developed for various river ice processes. They not only helped to advance understanding of the physical processes by complementing field and laboratory studies, but also provided tools for planning and design of engineering projects. In this paper, models of various river ice processes during the winter, from freeze-up to breakup, are reviewed after a brief overview of river ice phenomena. Following the discussion of these ‘component’ models, a discussion on ‘comprehensive’ models and an analytical framework which links all river ice processes in a coherent manner is presented."

In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat island (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 Köppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions towards a more salutogenic urban design."

In these systems, a macroscopic wave function (order parameter) appears because of Bose–Einstein condensation, which creates quantized vortices. Turbulence consisting of quantized vortices is called quantum turbulence (QT). The study of quantized vortices and QT has increased in intensity for two reasons. The first is that recent studies of QT are considerably advanced over older studies, which were chiefly limited to thermal counterflow in <span class=""math""><math><msup is=""true""><mrow is=""true""></mrow><mrow is=""true""><mn is=""true"">4</mn></mrow></msup></math></span>He, which has no analog with classical traditional turbulence, whereas new studies on QT are focused on a comparison between QT and classical turbulence. The second reason is the realization of atomic BECs in 1995, for which modern optical techniques enable the direct control and visualization of the condensate and can even change the interaction; such direct control is impossible in other quantum condensates like superfluid helium and superconductors.

In recent years, the software, engineering and computer technology available to predict the design loads imposed on ships and offshore structures has improved dramatically. Notwithstanding, with the stepwise increase in the size and structural complexity of ships and floating offshore installations and the advances in the framework of Rules and Standards it has become necessary to utilise the latest technologies to assess the design loads on new designs. Along the lines of the recommendations from the International Ship and Offshore Structures Committee (ISSC) I.2 on Loads this paper reviews some of the recent advances in the assessment of loads for ships and offshore structures with the aim to draw the overall technological landscape available for further understanding, validation and implementation by the academic and industrial communities. Particular emphasis is attributed on methodologies applicable for the prediction of environmental and operational loads from waves, wind, current, ice, slamming, sloshing and operational factors. Consideration is also given to deterministic and statistical load predictions based on model experiments, full-scale measurements and theoretical methods."

Before a new porous or perforated breakwater concept enters into the stage of physical model testing, careful parametric studies and mechanism studies need to be carried out to examine its feasibility and to ensure the success of the model test. Among the non-physical modelling approaches, analytical and numerical methods based on potential flow theory are often used as they are more efficient than those allowing for flow viscosity. Although the conditions of non-viscous, incompressible fluid and irrotational flow are assumed, the potential flow models can assist in understanding major mechanisms that determine the performance of porous/perforated breakwaters and provide satisfactory estimates on important hydrodynamic parameters. Consequently, they are a popular choice in the study of porous/perforated breakwaters until today. Despite the long history of application, the potential flow models continue to witness recent developments and improvements that aim to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the modelling. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the analytical and numerical applications of potential flow models on porous/perforated breakwaters, including the theories of porosity models, novel developments and applications of various analytical and numerical approaches."

Rapid urbanization and climate change are expected to exacerbate urban surface effects on health, economy and the environment. It is therefore necessary to study the impact of urban surfaces on local and large scale surface and atmospheric processes. High resolution climate models with heterogeneous but realistic land surface representations can reproduce the urban surface effects relatively accurately. In the last three decades, there have been interesting developments in urban surface parameterizations. Simultaneously, the growing computational power has created an opportunity to run climate models at high resolution. Therefore, this is probably the most favorable time to couple different scale urban surface parameterizations with climate models to better understand urban-rural weather or climate interactions and to generate information required for urban-related impact and adaptation studies. However, very few review studies have focused on the growing need for urban surface parameterizations processes relevant to improve urban weather and climate prediction systems at various scales. This paper therefore fills this gap by critically reviewing urban surface parameterization developments, evaluating the most important processes and identifying the data needed for linking urban surface models to climate models over the last three decades. Consequently, it proposes ways to improve the existing processes and/or incorporate the missing processes for better simulation of urban weather/climate. It also explores progress towards future applications of urban climate models and processes that these models need to represent in response to changes in human energy consumption behavior from fossilized fuel to renewable energy resources, climate change, population growth, land use/cover transition and pollution."

The symmetry and conservation laws of the equation are analyzed. The solution to the equation is obtained through the Jacobi elliptic function expansion method, and the effect of high-order terms and wave numbers on the waves are discussed. The results show that both the higher order terms and the numbers of waves affect the height of the amplitude of the wave. When the high-order terms are present, the height of the amplitude is lower than when the high-order terms are not present and when the wave number is larger, the height of the amplitude is also higher, and this conclusion is not affected by the presence or absence of high-order terms. Finally, the stability of the equation is analyzed by the concept of linear stability analysis. It is pointed out that when the higher order term does not exist, the stable region of the equation disappears and the equation becomes unstable."

Arrays may include 1000s of devices. The associated foundations or anchors may encounter a range of seafloor sediment types and geotechnical properties. Wave and tidal energy convertors induce unique loads on foundations and anchors that are different from other seafloor engineering applications. Thus, there is a need for a combination of advanced site analysis and performance assessment. Geotechnical engineering plays the vital role of ensuring that foundation and anchor systems perform successfully for MRE devices. Our paper reviews the unique frequency and magnitude of loading regimes experienced by MRE arrays. We examine potential loading conditions on the foundation-anchor systems. Loading regimes include environmental and system loads from single devices or arrays of devices. We present specific load examples from field data. We explore the applicable geotechnical approaches to address these conditions, including constitutive models that may or may not adequately capture the response of the seafloor sediments to the MRE loads. Partially to fully dynamic constitutive model formulations may be necessary to properly model sediment-fluid hydromechanical response to MRE loading. Spacing of full MRE arrays and spatial variability in sediment properties may require multiple foundation types."

Capture by atmospheric moisture (clouds, rain, fog), surface water (rivers, lakes, seas), and deposition on vegetation and soil constitute the main pathways for ammonia removal from the troposphere. Ammonia catalyzes the atmospheric oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide and reacts rapidly with acidic components of the atmosphere (sulfuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acids). The ammonium salts formed are the main components of smog aerosols and thus affect the opacity of the atmosphere and the earth radiation budget. Slow oxidation of ammonia in the atmosphere plays only a minor role in its removal. The data obtained for ammonia reactions under normal atmospheric conditions are generally applicable to model chemical reactions occurring during massive release of ammonia in the atmosphere, provided the impact of high ammonia concentration on the mass transfer processes that control some of these reactions, are taken into account."

However, without appropriate building designs and efficient heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, large space buildings exhibit poor thermal comfort and high energy consumption. In this study, the thermal non-uniformity and energy migration in large space buildings were analysed. Considering the complex influential factors and large-span structure, zonal modelling as an intermediate approach between the nodal model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can provide a rough and quick estimation of the airflow and temperature distributions in large spaces. The literature was reviewed comprehensively and in depth with a focus on the evolvement, principles, characteristics, validation, and applications of various zonal models over the past three decades. Recent zonal models have gradually overcome the initial imperfections and improve reliability by establishing simplified momentum equations. These models have exhibited remarkable superiority in computational efficiency, and the simulation accuracy is comparable to actual conditions and CFD. Moreover, the zonal model is promising for coupling with the multizone model and the building energy model, particularly in the dynamic, long-term analysis of large space buildings. Hence, its development and application should be promoted further."

Air quality has manifold effects on health, ecosystems, heritage and climate. In this review the state of scientific understanding in relation to global and regional air quality is outlined. The review discusses air quality, in terms of emissions, processing and transport of trace gases and aerosols. New insights into the characterization of both natural and anthropogenic emissions are reviewed looking at both natural (e.g. dust and lightning) as well as plant emissions. Trends in anthropogenic emissions both by region and globally are discussed as well as biomass burning emissions. In terms of chemical processing the major air quality elements of ozone, non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and aerosols are covered. A number of topics are presented as a way of integrating the process view into the atmospheric context; these include the atmospheric oxidation efficiency, halogen and HO<sub>x</sub> chemistry, nighttime chemistry, tropical chemistry, heat waves, megacities, biomass burning and the regional hot spot of the Mediterranean. New findings with respect to the transport of pollutants across the scales are discussed, in particular the move to quantify the impact of long-range transport on regional air quality.

To obtain a more widely applicable CHF prediction method, many mechanistic models have been proposed based on single channels with a good precision. Since the annular flow may occur in rod bundle in gas-liquid two-phase region for boiling water reactors (BWRs), it is essential to apply the annular film dryout (AFD) mechanistic models to rod bundle geometry. Among many existing AFD mechanistic models that are available to review, two major categories can be distinguished with considerable attention: the three-fluid model and the film analysis model. Many studies show that it is feasible to couple AFD mechanistic model with sub-channel analysis using suitable coupling strategies, but some crucial issues have not been solved. In view of these facts, this paper initially highlights the basis of AFD mechanistic model and its application to rod bundle. Then some factors which have predominant influence on the accuracy of the mechanistic model are reviewed and analyzed, including cross flow, onset of annular flow, inception fraction for droplet entrainment, boiling and spacer grid effect, dryout criteria. Finally, conclusions and prospects in this research field are summarized and proposed."

Grain properties, such as shape and drag coefficient, which affect terminal settling velocity, also control the threshold of initiation of motion and sediment entrainment into suspension. Terminal settling velocity therefore provides insights into sediment dynamics in modern and past depositional environments and is important for marine engineering works. Despite the global importance of resedimented carbonates the study of particle hydrodynamics is strongly biased towards terrigenous sediments. This paper presents a review of the settling hydrodynamics of carbonate grains and associated particle properties, such as shape, grain size and density. For carbonate grains these parameters are more complex than for siliciclastic counterparts due to their common biogenic origin, introducing a wide range of morphologies, densities and abrasion products as a result of the skeletal nature of such grains. This review includes an extensive database of published composition-specific settling velocities, as well as densities of common carbonate constituents. The database includes corals, coralline red algae, bivalves, brachiopods, gastropods, <em>Halimeda</em> green algae, bryozoans, crinoids, echinoderms, Alcyonarian spicules, numerous benthic and planktic foraminifers, and fecal pellets. Grain density as a function of skeletal structure and mineralogy exerts another control on settling velocity, with unclarity in density definitions hampering effective communication in the literature. The variation in single-grain hydrodynamic behaviour implies careful application of previously proposed equations for the prediction of settling velocity of bulk sand. Despite a firm basis there is a need for additional systematic composition-specific investigations to enable the adequate prediction of carbonate particle hydrodynamics due to the broad spectrum of forms and densities. Emerging technologies such as automated particle velocimetry, computational fluid dynamics, machine learning and microtomography provide exciting avenues for future understanding of the hydrodynamic behaviour of particles with the complexity of natural carbonate grains."

Since the size distribution of loess deposits depends on distance to the dust source, and environmental conditions at the source, during transport, and at deposition, loess particle size distributions and derived statistical measures are widely used proxies in Quaternary paleoenvironmental studies. However, the interpretation of these proxies often only considers dust transport processes. To move beyond such overly simplistic proxy interpretations, and toward proxy interpretations that consider the range of environmental processes that determine loess particle size distribution variations we provide a comprehensive review on the physics of dust particle mobilization and deposition. Furthermore, using high-resolution bulk loess and quartz grain size datasets from a last glacial/interglacial sequence, we show that, because grain size distributions are affected by multiple, often stochastic processes, changes in these distributions over time allow multiple interpretations for the driving processes. Consequently, simplistic interpretations of proxy variations in terms of only one factor (e.g. wind speed) are likely to be inaccurate. Nonetheless using loess proxies to understand temporal changes in the dust cycle and environmental parameters requires (i) a careful site selection, to minimize the effects of topography and source distance, and (ii) the joint use of bulk and quartz grain size proxies, together with high resolution mass accumulation rate calculations if possible."

The one- and multi-layer rotating shallow water models, as well as their parent primitive equation model, possess a gap in the spectrum of linear excitations that separate the fast inertia–gravity wave (IGW) motions and slow vortex motions. The vortex motions at small Rossby numbers are in geostrophic balance—for example, close to the equilibrium between the Coriolis force and the pressure force. Under hypothesis of splitting—in particular, noninteraction of fast and slow motions, useful balanced models may be derived from the full dynamical equations by using exclusively slow time-scales. This coupling at the level of initial conditions becomes dramatic in the non-localized initial conditions at the boundary in the case of laterally bounded domains, where initial conditions of the fast component (Kelvin wave) enter explicitly in the evolution equation of the slow component."
227,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045793023001408,Global spectral analysis: Review of numerical methods,"The design and analysis of numerical methods are usually guided by the following: (a) von Neumann analysis using Fourier series expansion of unknowns, (b) the modified differential equation approach, and (c) a more generalized approach that analyzes numerical methods globally, using Fourier–Laplace transform to treat the total or disturbance quantities in terms of waves. This is termed as the global spectral analysis (GSA). GSA can easily handle non-periodic problems, by invoking wave properties of the field through the correct numerical dispersion relation, which is central to the design and analysis. This has transcended dimensionality of the problem, while incorporating various physical processes e.g. by studying convection, diffusion and reaction as the prototypical elements involved in defining the physics of the problem. Although this is used for fluid dynamical problems, it can also explain many multi-physics and multi-scale problems. This review describes this powerful tool of scientific computing, with new results originating from GSA: (i) providing a common framework to analyze both hyperbolic and dispersive wave problems; (ii) analyze numerical methods by comparing physical and numerical dispersion relation, which leads to the new class of dispersion relation preserving (DRP) schemes; (iii) developing error dynamics as a distinct tool, identifying sources of numerical errors involving both the truncation and round-off error. Such studies of error dynamics provide the epistemic tool of analysis rather than an aleatoric tool, which depends on uncertainty quantification for high performance computing (HPC). One of the central themes of GSA covers the recent advances in understanding numerical phenomenon like focusing, which defied analysis so far. An application of GSA shown here for the objective evaluation of the so-called DNS by pseudo-spectral method for spatial discretization along with time integration by two-stage Runge–Kutta method is performed. GSA clearly shows that this should not qualify as DNS for multiple reasons. A new design of HPC methods for peta- and exa-flop computing tools necessary for parallel computing by compact schemes are also described."

Challenges involved in managing waste rock include the large volume of waste rock produced and the difficulty in predicting the quality and quantity of leach water due to the chemical and physical heterogeneities in the waste rock, and the highly non-linear coupling of geochemical and physical processes. Many important studies have been conducted over the past decade, particularly at the field scale, that have investigated the geochemical, hydrological, microbiological, and gas and heat transport aspects of waste-rock. These studies show that although the parameters and processes that influence AMD generation and solute release are fundamentally similar between different waste-rock piles, major differences in the dominant mechanisms of water, gas and heat transport result from differences in the physical and mineralogical properties of the rock piles, and the climatic conditions, including the amount of precipitation and prevailing temperatures. Accurate prediction of the leach water quality from waste-rock requires a detailed characterization of the properties of the rock piles and the coupling of processes specific to the particular conditions. This paper provides a review of the physical and mineralogical characteristics of waste-rock piles, followed by a discussion of the principal processes related to sulfide oxidation and solute loading, and concluding with a discussion on acid mine drainage prediction and prevention techniques."

Such disturbances often drive interplanetary shocks in front of their leading regions. Strong shocks transfer momentum and energy into the solar wind ahead of them which in turn enhance the solar wind interaction with magnetic fields in its way. Shocks then eventually strike the Earth’s magnetosphere and trigger a myriad of geomagnetic effects observed not only by spacecraft in space, but also by magnetometers on the ground. Recently, it has been revealed that shocks can show different geoeffectiveness depending closely on the angle of impact. Generally, frontal shocks are more geoeffective than inclined shocks, even if the former are comparatively weaker than the latter. This review is focused on results obtained from modeling and experimental efforts in the last 15 years. Some theoretical and observational background are also provided."

231,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037015731830276X,Complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis,"In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis."

Routinely evidenced in a range from the large-scale solar structures down to the characteristic scales of ions and electrons, turbulence is a major cross-scale energy transfer mechanism in space plasmas. At intermediate scales, the fate of the energy in the outer space is mainly determined by the interplay of turbulent motions and propagating waves. More mechanisms are advocated to account for the transfer and conversion of energy, including magnetic reconnection, emission of radiation and particle energization, all contributing to make the dynamical state of solar and heliospheric plasmas difficult to predict. The characterization of the energy transfer in space plasmas benefited from numerous robotic missions. However, together with breakthrough technologies, novel theoretical developments and methodologies for the analysis of data played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of how energy is transferred across the scales in the space. In recent decades, several scaling laws were obtained providing effective ways to model the energy flux in turbulent plasmas. Under certain assumptions, these relations enabled to utilize reduced knowledge (in terms of degrees of freedom) of the fields from spacecraft observations to obtain direct estimates of the energy transfer rates (and not only) in the interplanetary space, also in the proximity of the Sun and planets. Starting from the first third-order exact law for the magnetohydrodynamics by Politano and Pouquet (1998), we present a detailed review of the main scaling laws for the energy transfer in plasma turbulence and their application, presenting theoretical, numerical and observational milestones of what has become one of the main approaches for the characterization of turbulent dynamics and energetics in space plasmas."

The limitations are mainly related to location, water flow, escapees and fish health. The present status of flow hydrodynamics within and around sea-cages is reviewed in this paper, providing a framework for understanding the spatial and temporal variability of key environmental parameters within and outside sea-cages. The paper presents contemporary experiments on drag forces on net panels, model-scale cages, the biological effects of fish, fish movements and fouling as the major topics. It includes also a presentation of different theoretical studies as an attempt to simulate experiments. The accumulated experimental results are sorted out following a gradually increasing scale from the cruciform as a basic element of a net, via net panels to a net cage with solidity and velocity as the main parameters, while the effect of fish and fouling are discussed only at the full-scale level. The compilation is important to understand issues related to the design and mechanics of net cages, taking into account fish behavior in relation to future engineering development within the field of hydrodynamics in aquaculture cage farming. Improved knowledge of water movement through aquaculture cages is critical for future development of efficient and sustainable aquaculture, including a shift toward more exposed locations."

The development of larger and faster computers now allows a global forecast to be made in three minutes per day using a 150 km grid in the horizontal, 15 levels in the vertical, and one of the very efficient integration schemes now available. The forecasts produced are useful guidance to forecasters to about four days on average, but there is a large difference in performance from case to case. In this review recent developments in understanding the solutions to the governing equations are discussed, some of the efficient integration schemes are described in detail, and an example of the current standard of forecasts is displayed."

The twofold aim was to emphasize both the potential against local overheating in a variety of climatic contexts and the extreme heterogeneity in terms of investigation techniques and performance metrics that hinder the construction of a cohesive body of knowledge. In addition to statistics and patterns, data were screened to outline theoretical and methodological trends and gaps and to detect geographic biases and climate dependencies. Indeed, each study was thoroughly described and comparatively discussed according to (i) the investigational method (purely experimental studies, purely numerical studies and those combining field tests with simulations), (ii) the results in terms of cooling, humidification and comfort, also in relation to the adopted performance metrics (iii) the design novelty. Most relevant approaches and findings were discussed and compared to identify governing variables, optimized configurations, unchartered solutions and criticalities. Overall, the collected data qualify water spraying as a cost-effective, versatile and high-impact blue mitigator. Opportunities and challenges towards an informed use emerged and will help delineating appropriate guidelines for practitioners involved in town development, to deliver strategies and precautions."

Besides temperature, all flows must also be described by their velocity. As these flows are often turbulent, an important capability is to measure both velocity and temperature at the same time to capture, for example, the turbulent heat flux term appearing in the energy conservation equation.</p><p id=""spara0001a"">This paper reviews temperature measurement techniques for fluid flows that are based on thermographic phosphors, which are materials that possess temperature-dependent luminescence properties. Phosphor particles are seeded into the fluid flow of interest. Following laser excitation, the luminescence of the particles is detected, and the temperature measurement is derived using either the spectral intensity ratio or the lifetime. The same particles can also be used for velocity measurements using well-established particle-based approaches, such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) or particle image velocimetry (PIV), producing instantaneously correlated vector-scalar data. First introduced over a decade ago, this concept has since evolved and is currently capable of two-dimensional measurements in the temperature range 200–900 K. At lower temperatures a single-shot spatial precision better than 4 K is possible, as is imaging at sampling rates in the multi-kHz range. The approach is flexible, allowing, for example, techniques which probe single particles for point measurements with a 200 µm spatial resolution. Besides many validation experiments, the method has been applied in internal combustion engines, a falling film absorber, a high-pressure reaction vessel and in enclosed wind tunnels to study various turbulent heat transfer and reactive flow phenomena.</p><p id=""spara0001b"">The objective of this article is to provide the first review of this emerging field. The focus is on 1) the method: how has the principle of phosphor thermometry been used for flow measurements, and what instrumentation and processing steps were implemented; 2) how phosphor particles were characterised, and which phosphors are best-suited to temperature measurements in flows; and 3) the applications of the technique. Throughout, and with a detailed analysis of various sources of error, the review endeavours to compare the work and identify common aspects, advantages and limitations of the studies that led to successful flow measurements, and therefore should serve as a guide for researchers using the method. The article also briefly summarises the various challenges which the authors consider are key to the future development of these diagnostics."

The experimental support for the Einstein equivalence principle is summarized. If this principle is valid, gravitation must be described by a curved space-time, “metric” theory of gravity. General properties of metric theories are described and the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism for treating the weak-field, slow-motion limit of such theories is set up. A zoo of selected metric theories of gravity is presented. Experimental tests of metric theories are then described, including the “classical” tests, tests of the strong equivalence principle, and others. The possibility of using gravitational-wave observations to test metric theories is discussed. A review is presented of the binary pulsar, in which the first evidence for gravitational radiation has been found. Finally cosmological tests of alternative theories are briefly described."

Range and cost have been the main aspects that continue to hinder the development of EVs. This paper provides a comprehensive outlook of the five major areas of optimization (over the last two decades) in EVs i.e., design optimization, energy management, optimal control, optimized charging/discharging and routing with both single and multi-objective methods examined and analyzed. The mathematical modelling, formulation of objective functions and constraints are studied followed by an in-depth survey of the state-of-the-art publications in each category. Furthermore, a classification of the various analytical, conventional and nature-inspired optimization algorithms (swarm-intelligent, evolutionary and modern meta-heuristics) based on their popularity is made with an analysis of their merits and demerits followed by a study of the various constraint handling techniques. Additionally, a literature survey of the advanced and improved variants of these meta-heuristics is also made providing a systematic reference for EV optimization with intelligent algorithms. Finally, a classification of the various simulatory platforms and driving cycles is provided to help the upcoming researchers gain insightfulness and expertise on the ongoing trends in the EV optimization domain."
